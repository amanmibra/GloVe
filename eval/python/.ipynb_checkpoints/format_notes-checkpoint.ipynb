      "Admission Date: [**2118-6-2**] Discharge Date: [**2118-6-14**] Date of Birth: Sex: F Service: MICU and then to [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 81-year-old female with a history of emphysema (not on home O2), who presents with three days of shortness of breath thought by her primary care doctor to be a COPD flare. Two days prior to admission, she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%. She has also been on levofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room. In the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was 100% on CPAP. She was not able to be weaned off of this despite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2. Review of systems is negative for the following: Fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight, gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes, palpitations, orthopnea. Is positive for the following: Chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with exertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally related, but is improved with nebulizer treatment. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. COPD. Last pulmonary function tests in [**2117-11-3**] demonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of predicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of 67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator treatment. The FVC, however, does significantly improve with bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive ventilatory defect. The patient has never been on home oxygen prior to this recent episode. She has never been on steroid taper or been intubated in the past. 2. Lacunar CVA. MRI of the head in [**2114-11-4**] demonstrates \"mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2 signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres as well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to the right of midline. The abnormalities, while nonspecific in etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic microvascular infarction. There is no mass, lesion, shift of the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus. The major vascular flow patterns are preserved. There is moderate right maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left maxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal thickening. These abnormalities could represent an allergic or some other type of inflammatory process. Additionally noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella turcica\". 3. Angina: Most recent stress test was in [**2118-1-3**] going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of 10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence of ischemic EKG changes or symptoms. The imaging portion of the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and a calculated ejection fraction of 84%. The patient denies angina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks. Are alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin. 4. Hypothyroidism on Synthroid. 5. Depression on Lexapro. 6. Motor vehicle accident with head injury approximately 10 years ago. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d. 2. Prednisone 60 mg, 50 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg. 3. Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. 4. Imdur 60 mg q.d. 5. Synthroid 75 mcg q.d. 6. Pulmicort nebulizer b.i.d. 7. Albuterol nebulizer q.4. prn. 8. Lexapro 10 mg q.d. 9. Protonix 40 mg q.d. 10. Aspirin 81 mg q.d. ALLERGIES: Norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives with her husband, Dr. [**Known lastname 1809**] an eminent Pediatric Neurologist at [**Hospital3 1810**]. The patient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10 years. She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code. PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION: Blood pressure 142/76, heart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97% axillary temperature. She was saturating at 100% on CPAP with dry mucous membranes. An elderly female in no apparent distress. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements are intact. Oropharynx difficult to assess due to CPAP machine. No evidence of jugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP machine obscures the neck exam. Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. Heart exam: Tachycardic, regular, obscured by loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory phase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the lung fields. Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, obese, no masses. Mild edema of the lower extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes. There is a right hand hematoma. Strength is assessed as [**5-9**] in the lower extremities, [**5-9**] in the upper extremities with a normal mental status and cognition. LABORATORY STUDIES: White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets 300. Chem-7: 127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143. Troponin was negative. CKs were negative times three. Initial blood gas showed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54. Chest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia, segmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus segmental atelectasis. EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal axis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes. BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia: The patient was initially placed on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation despite CPAP machine. She was also given nebulizer treatments q.4h. as well as chest PT. The nebulizers were increased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathing. Due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing, the patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction. A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent with tracheomalacia. On [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left main stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia. On [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical floor. On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off on [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2 liters, 92% on room air. On [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional Pulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with followup within six weeks' time status post placement of stents in respiratory failure. 2. Cardiovascular: The patient was ruled out for a MI. She did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain, which showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative troponin, negative CKs x3. She was continued on aspirin, Imdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient regimen. 3. Hypertension: She was maintained on diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and normalization of electrolytes. 4. Hematuria: The patient had intermittent hematuria likely secondary to Foley placement. The Foley catheter was discontinued on [**2118-6-14**]. She had serial urinalyses, which were all negative for signs of infection. 5. Hyperglycemia: Patient was placed on insulin-sliding scale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced. This worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels once the steroids were tapered to off. 6. Leukocytosis: Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of 20 to 22 during much of her hospital course. As the steroids were tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**] was 15,000. It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe pneumonia. 7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d. from [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**]. This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**] for an additional seven day course given the fact that she still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the left lower lobe. 8. Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on outpatient medical regimen. 9. Depression: The patient was continued on Lexapro per outpatient regimen. It is recommended that she follow up with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital course, and did appear clinically to be depressed. 10. Prophylaxis: She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor with subQ Heparin. 11. Sore throat: The patient did have a sore throat for much of the hospital course post extubation. This was treated with Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution containing Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime. 12. Communication/code status: The patient was full code throughout her hospital course, and communication was maintained with the patient and her husband. 13. Muscle weakness: The patient did have profound muscle weakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found to have impaired functional mobility, impaired musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired endurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine to sit. However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair for approximately one hour. On motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower extremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at the elbows, and [**4-8**] hips. It was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a prolonged hospital course. 14. Speech/swallow: The patient had a Speech and Swallow evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of vocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement. DISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient was able to oxygenate on room air at 93% at the time of discharge. She was profoundly weak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood pressure. Her respirations were much improved albeit with transmitted upper airway sounds. DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d. 2. Citalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. 4. Fluticasone 110 mcg two puffs inhaled b.i.d. 5. Salmeterol Diskus one inhalation b.i.d. 6. Acetaminophen 325-650 mg p.o. q.4-6h. prn. 7. Ipratropium bromide MDI two puffs inhaled q.2h. prn. 8. Albuterol 1-2 puffs inhaled q.2h. prn. 9. Zolpidem tartrate 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn. 10. Isosorbide dinitrate 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. 11. Diltiazem 60 mg p.o. q.i.d. 12. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.24h. 13. Trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn. 14. SubQ Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until such time that the patient is able to get out of bed twice a day. 15. Cepacol lozenges q.2h. prn. 16. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a seven day course to be completed on [**2118-6-21**]. 17. Kaopectate/Benadryl/lidocaine 5 mL p.o. b.i.d. prn, not to be given around mealtimes for concern of dysphagia induced by lidocaine. 18. Lorazepam 0.5-2 mg IV q.6h. prn. FOLLOW-UP PLANS: The patient is recommended to followup with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1407**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1408**] within two weeks of leaving of the hospital. She is also recommended to followup with the Interventional Pulmonary service for followup status post stent placement. She is also recommended to followup with a neurologist if her muscle weakness does not improve within one week on physical therapy with concern for steroid-induced myopathy. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Tracheomalacia status post tracheal and left main stem bronchial stent placement. 2. Hypertension. 3. Hypothyroidism. 4. Restrictive lung defect. 5. Depression.

Over the past five years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing. In [**2118-6-4**] she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she required intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on [**2118-6-9**] revealed marked narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with tracheomalacia. She subsequently underwent placement of two silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of chest pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy on [**2118-8-1**] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in her respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c [**2119-4-19**] in anticipation of surgery. In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any time.

This morning patient developed an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER. . According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND, dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning. . In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2. Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1, aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2 hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x 18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2. . In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.

Limited exam. Echo ([**2124-7-24**]) - There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. CXR ([**2124-8-5**]) - Kyphotic positioning. Compared with one day earlier and allowing for technical differences, the right-sided effusion may be slightly larger. Otherwise, no significant change is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small left effusion. As noted, a right effusion is again seen, possibly slightly larger on the current examination, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF. Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.

Per report, patient felt like this with prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible pneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with this. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew parainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on solumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics were stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were continued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become interimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the 50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of note, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's family and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she would not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued again and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical floor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with nebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently diuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks of anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her breathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was begun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3 more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4 days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop. . # Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG tube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach body, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was negative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat EGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved given abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable with no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the patient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO pantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held. . # Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness at the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was checked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and physical rehab. . # CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents. Continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI bleeding (see above) . # Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due to hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on [**7-26**] for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient was extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. Speech and swallow were consulted following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision. # Goals of care: PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions regarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed along with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's extubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be DNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on comfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the floor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated. After several days with stable or improved overall clinical status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate, okay to intubate.

Fracture of the C6 as described involving the right pedicle (extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7 facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament. 2. Lucency in the right posterior C1 ring may represent a chronic injury. Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 pedicle on the left. 3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments with compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is further described above. CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2162-3-3**]) IMPRESSION: 1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. 2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right hemithorax, likely pseudotumors. 3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non- emergent basis. 4. Bilateral renal cysts. 5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra. Recommend emergent repositioning. CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([**2162-3-3**]) 1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures. 2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe. Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit. 3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate with CT C- spine performed concurrently. HEAD CT ([**2162-3-3**]) 1. No acute intracranial hemprrhage. 2. Left frontal scalp hematoma. 3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from facial bone CT scan. 4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to dedeicated CT C-spine for further detail. 5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old infarction. CHEST [**2162-3-10**] The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid within the major fissure. CT HEAD [**2162-3-11**] 1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend followp imaging. 2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size. 3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia. 4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated maxillofacial CT. RIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([**2162-3-11**]) Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis. Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis, intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the subscapularis tendon. Increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest CT RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-3-13**]) 1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the right cephalic vein. 2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual son[**Name (NI) 493**] features somewhat suspicious for malignancy. Followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy may be considered at that time if no interval improvement. [**2162-3-14**] CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and adrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air. There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle, tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm. CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged, measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free fluid. BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is DISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large acetabular osteophytes. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right. 2. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No associated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q. injections. 3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded. If this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for further evaluation. 4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too small to accurately characterize. 5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts. 6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.

[**2162-3-16**] VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the speech pathologist. ORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, AP tongue movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue. PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar elevation. There is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. There is moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. There is residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate impairment of bolus propulsion. There was aspiration of both thin and puree barium. IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids and puree. For additional information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's report from the same day. [**2162-3-18**] CT Head w/out: FINDINGS: There is a small amount of blood layering in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not as dense given evolution. No new hemorrhage is identified. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to involutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is unchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck secondary to recent spinal surgery. IMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small intraventricular hemorrhage. No discharge labs as patient CMO. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after his fall from a height of approximatly 10 feet. CT scans of his chest, abdomen and pelvis were negative for pathology. CT scan of his C-spine showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at C6-7. He was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture. C-spine fracture: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] two surgical procedures to stabilized his c-spine.

Brain, left frontal (A): 1. Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous malformation of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced fibrinoid necrosis. 2. Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior hemorrhages. 2. Left frontal radionecrosis and residual AVM (B): 1. Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous malformation of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced fibrinoid necrosis. 2. Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior hemorrhages. Clinical: Radionecrosis. CT Head post-op [**8-10**]: FINDINGS: There is a left-sided frontal craniotomy with surgical resection of the enhancing \"mass\" noted in previous studies. There is extensive confluent hypodensity in the left frontoparietal region, that likely represents post-radiation vasogenic edema with resultant 8.5-mm shift of normally-midline structures, not significantly changed from the previous MR. There is a tiny focus of hyperdensity in the postoperative field which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage. There is expost-operative pneumocephalus and subcutaneous air noted. IMPRESSION: Status post left craniotomy and resection of AVM and possible \"mass\"-like radiation necrosis, with small hyperdense focus in the operative bed, likely representing very small hemorrhage. Extensive vasogenic edema persists. Brief Hospital Course: Post-operatively she was admitted to the ICU for observation s/p resection. Her Post-op head CT was negative for bleeding. She remained intubated immediately post-op. She was weaned and extubated on [**8-11**] and did very well neurologically. The patient was transferred out of the ICU later that day. She was ambulating without difficulty, her pain was well-controlled, and she was taking in food with no nausea/vomiting.

He also has severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass surgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart failure. He states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at 6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP 109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart failure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70. He given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis), Nitropaste [**1-3**]\", and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low BP). On further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis. But he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat, carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated with dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms occur about every day to every other day and have been stable over the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify the amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain. ROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox. Past Medical History: 1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG twice (vide infra). 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes mellitus. 4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Peripheral arterial disease with occluded left common iliac artery, S/P right iliac artery stenting and femoral-to-femoral bypass, further angioplasty to the right profunda. 5.

CAD: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension Cardiac History: CABG in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL), with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA) Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2120**] anatomy as follows: Patent SVG to OM1, patent SVG to PDA which filled the distal PDA as well as the R-PL via a jump segment. Stump occlusion of a graft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that could be documented of a graft to the left. Other SVG's were not able to be selectively engaged. Supravalvular aortography demonstrated no other patent grafts. Patent LIMA to mid-LAD, which also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft that was interposed between the LAD and the diagonal. Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use. There is no history of alcohol abuse. Family History: There is extensive family history of early coronary disease (father died of MI at 44, one brother died in 40's, one in 50's, sister had stroke).

There are also frequent atrial premature beats. Intraventricular conduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave changes most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-4-9**] ventricular premature beats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical correlation is suggested. CXR [**2125-2-9**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. The heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the previous study. Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward the lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also new, most likely part of the heart failure. Left and right retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis. ECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images unavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased. Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 84 yo man with CAD s/p CABG twice with daily angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive heart failure. # CAD: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart failure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10 mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this well, however at approximately 8 pm on [**2125-2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] was transferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the 50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that he had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis). On transfer to the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and amiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. At this time his cardiac enzymes became very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe aortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray. Levophed was discontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off pressors with MAP's 60 - 70. On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in the ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s upon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creat 1.7. A cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a 3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement. On [**2-16**], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to 60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given 1L NS with no response in BP. The patient was mentating but became short of breath with IVF. He had worsening EKG changes. He was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood pressure. He was brought to the catherization laboratory for potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At that point, he suffered a PEA arrest and could not be resuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm. # Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He was treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [**2-16**] to po Lasix 80 mg po twice daily. # Rhythm: Patient was in NSR on admission. On HD #2, he had chest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above. Telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the CCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered over the subsequent weeks. # Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined (creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7 - 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3). # Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley placement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on [**2-16**] with gradual resolution of hematuria. # Diabetes: Due to acute renal failre, metformin was discontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding scale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime. # Hematoma. The patient developed a small hematoma at the site of his right internal jugular venous access after catheter removal. This was treated with local compression.

A brief-problem based hospital course is outlined below. 1) presumed c.diff infxn- Admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin and IV metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. Cholestyramine was initially given for toxin binding. WBC was 30 on admission and trended down with ABX; however, C.diff toxin neg x5, so diagnosis remains presumptive. C. diff B toxin was sent and was negative as well. She completed a 3 week course of PO vanco and IV flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. She subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was able to tolerate PO's. 2) [**Name (NI) 1866**] Pt began having episodes of BRBPR on [**4-25**] with resultant slow HCT drop. GI and surgery were consulted. Pt had no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel or dehiscence. Pt was also having intermittent episodes of tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic phenomena with acute ischemia. However, she had no abdominal pain to suggest this. Colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. Surgery found that pt was not surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. Biopsy results showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin B. It is quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were the result of C dif infxn, which had been treated w/ABX and resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. As well, GI felt there may be a superimposed ischemic insult. No further work-up was performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis, following completion of cdiff treatment. 2) acute renal failure w/ CRI- Renal team was consulted on admisison. Baseline cr is approx 2.0. On admission this was significantly elevated to 4.1. FENA was c/w prerenal etiology and patient had R IJ placed in ED, started on NS for volume resusciation. This was undertaken slowly given that pt had an albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on CT. Fluids were changed to 1/2NS w/ bicarb on HD2. Cr trended down each day and the patient has maintained oxygenation. Alb/cr ratio not c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low alb was likely multifactorial. Pt initially required boluses of 500cc NS to maintain Uop ~20-30cc/hr. With hydration and improvement in her diarrhea, her Cr steadily decreased and returned to baseline of 1.6. She was seen by renal who felt that her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to ATN/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive overdiuresis. She did subsequently require aggressive diuresis given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips. However her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with diuresis. She did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. Therefore her lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down to 30. Her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of discharge. 3) [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic on admisison. Unclear why it was low when patient presented. Most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/SIRS response (given elev lactate on admission). Her PLT count dropped to 95 and DIC workup and HIT Ab were sent, both negative. Her PLT count rose as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range for the duration of her hosital course. 4) HTN - Pt's baseline SBP is in the 180s-200s range. On admission, BP was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. Her BP responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive. She was continued on metoprolol for HR/BP control and isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction. 5) CHF - Evidence of CHF on initial CXR. Her EF was found to be 40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event precipitating her failure. In support of this she was noted to have wall motion abnormalities on ECHO with inferoseptal/basal hypokinesis. Diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to her renal insufficiency and decompensated CHF. She was managed medically, and on [**5-10**] the CHF service was consulted for management. She was initiated on aggressive diuresis with IV lasix for goal -1.5L per day. She was transferred to the CCU briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her CHF (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative approximately 500 cc overnight). She was transferred back to the floor on lasix boluses. Due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg IV [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. Then started nesiritide [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min. Diuresed well to this and maintained BP well, however after increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. Stopped natrecor on [**5-17**]. Stopped lasix gtt on [**5-18**] given persistent good diuresis. Now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day + afterload reduction w/ Isordil/Hydral on [**5-22**]. At the time of discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching ins and outs daily. We will continue her on this regimen upon discharge. 7. Atrial fibrillation: Initially converted from RAF by medical cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the CCU at 13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. Became hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. Then again went into RAF on [**5-17**] early am. Initially HR controlled w/ IV lopressor/IV dilt. Then [**Hospital 1869**] medical cardioversion w/ procainamide. Became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10 minutes on procainamide [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was stopped and her blood pressures normalized. She then converted 10 min later to NSR. She has been in NSR the remainder of her hospital course. She is not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. In addition, amiodorone was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control. However, given the side effect profile, the family and patient were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at this time. They understand that there is a higher risk of conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for stroke without amiodorone. We will continue rate control with metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg TID, and may titrate up as needed to maintain HR <80. 8. CAD- wall motion abnormalities on ECHO w/ inferoseptal/basal HK. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical management. On statin/b-blocker. No plan for cath at this time given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. Also holding off on aspirin currently given her bleed risk. This will be re-addressed as an outpatient through her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. 9. Anemia- Initially had episode of GI bleed with blood loss anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. Hematocrit subsequently normalized. However, she subsequently was noted to have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. Repeat stool guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of bleed or hemolysis. Iron stores were also found to be within normal limits, with low TIBC and high ferritin suggesting anemia of chronic disease. This was felt likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency. She was started on EPO 2,000 Units q m,w,fr on [**5-22**]. The goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her history of CAD, however, we have held off on further transfusion at this time given her known CHF with recent severe volume overload. We have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg IV lasix for hct <28. 10. tachypnea- Resolved. Her transient tachypnea was felt likely secondary to volume overload. There was no evidence of infiltrate by CXR. Her ABG at the time on [**5-15**] showed 7.29/43/99. Her respiratory status subsequently improved that same day on [**5-15**] following IV lasix and atrovent nebulizers. Avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia. 11. F/E/N- Started on TPN for nutritional supplementation. She also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated regular solids and thin liquids. She has been taking in PO's as tolerated, but has continued to require TPN to reach nutritional goals. This will be continued upon discharge at rehab.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vital signs: Temperature 97.3, heart rate 116, blood pressure 140/palpable, respiratory rate 16, pulse oximetry of 100%. General: He was alert and oriented times three with a GCS of 15. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Extraocular motions were intact. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. The oropharynx was clear. The TMs were clear. Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no subcutaneous air noted. Cardiac: No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: There was a 1.5 cm left upper quadrant wound, otherwise diffusely tender. Back: No step-off. No deformities. Nontender. Extremities: A right above the knee amputation with prosthesis. Left leg with chronic venostasis changes. Rectal: Good tone. Contaminated by external blood. Neurological: No focal deficits. LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION: Chemistries generally normal with creatinine of 1.2. Blood gas 7.39/49/341/31/4, lactate 2.5, amylase 107, fibrinogen 171. PT 15.8, PTT 36.1, INR 1.7. His white blood count was 5.1, hematocrit 34.4. Urine toxicology was not performed. A chest x-ray was within normal limits, status post left subclavian line placement which was in place. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was taken to the Operating Room for wound exploration directly from the Trauma Room. The patient was taken to the Operating Room, as mentioned above, for an exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, and control of rectus and omental bleeding. The estimated blood loss was approximately 1,000 cc. Please see the operative note dictated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2199-2-8**] for complete report. The patient was then transferred to the SICU where his coagulopathy was corrected. He received 4 units of packed red cells, 4 units of FFP, and 1 cryoprecipitate. While on the unit, he was extubated on [**2199-2-10**], SICU day number three and he was noted to have progressive thrombocytopenia. His home p.o. medications were restarted as well. On [**2199-2-11**], hospital day number four, the patient was transferred to the floor. His diet was advanced and he was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to get his bowels moving postsurgically. The Pain Service was also consulted because of the patient's history of narcotic abuse and his continued complaints of pain. They recommended increasing his dose of Klonopin and starting MSIR. On hospital day number five, the patient was noted to have a heparin-induced antibody which may be one of the reasons he was coagulopathic on admission, although his HIV disease and other drug abuse cannot be ruled out as cause. His platelet count remained relatively stable, however, as did his hematocrit. By hospital day number six, the patient was doing somewhat better; however, after being noted to be somewhat sedated, his Klonopin dose as well as MSIR and methadone were decreased. The patient did work with Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate, hop a bit out of bed. Additionally, Case Management spoke with the patient's long-term nurse practitioner, who stated that at baseline he normally uses a wheelchair and occasionally walks on his prosthesis. Additionally, the nurse practitioner stated that the patient does chronically abuse drugs, both prescriptions and illicits, and advised not to give the patient any pain prescriptions upon discharge as he had more than enough at home. It was also discussed that the patient would often try to prolong his hospital courses in the past in an attempt to get more narcotics. On the date of discharge, the patient will be set up with VNA Services for home to change his dressings. He will also be instructed to follow-up with his primary care doctor or Trauma Clinic to have the staples removed from his abdominal wound. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE STATUS: Discharged to home with services. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Same as on admission. FOLLOW-UP PLANS: As mentioned above, with the Trauma Clinic and his primary care doctor.

Brief Hospital Course: 41 year old male with HIV/AIDS, previous R-sided endocarditis and severe TR, presented in cardiac tamponade from rehabilitation. CARDIAC TAMPONADE: On admission, he was transferred to the cardiac catherization lab, where over one liter of fluid was drained from his pericardial space. The fluid was sent for gram stain, culture, AFB, [**Doctor First Name **], TB PCR as well as viral studies and cytology. A pericardial drain was initially left in place, but given minimal drainage over 24 hours, was pulled prior to his transfer to the floor. The etiology of the pericardial effusion is unknown. He was followed by Cardiology on the floor and the initial plan was for a pericardial window, for both tissue and to prevent reaccumulation of fluid. The patient refused the procedure at this time. He will follow up as an outpatient to re-evaluate for the procedure. The effusion was followed by serial ECHO while the patient was in the hospital. There was no evidence of re-accumulation. He is scheduled for an outpatient ECHO in several weeks to evaluate the pericardial space for reaccumlation of effusion. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER: Per multiple EKGs, the patient appears to have developed new a fib/flutter. Given his guaiac positive stools, it is not advisable to start anticoagulation at this time. The patient is being rate controlled on a low dose of beta-blocker, which appears to be effective. He will be followed by outpatient Cardiology. ANEMIA: The patient had a hematocrit drop during this admission. His lab studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease, however, the patient was found to have guaiac positive stools. GI was consulted and recommeded colonoscopy and EGD. The patient was unable to tolerate the prep and thus the colonoscopy was cancelled. His EGD demonstrated gastritis and thrush. He was started on fluconazole to treat the thrush. He was also transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate hematocrit response. HIV/AIDS: The patient had a CD4 count checked during his last admission, it was found to be 132 with a viral load >100K. Given his past noncompliance with HAART therapy and the risk of developing drug resistant HIV, HAART was not restarted. Pt is willing to restart HARRT, and the plan remains to restart medications at rehabilitation. Bactrim was continued for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. OSTEOMYELITIS: The patient was previously admitted for left ankle pain. He was followed previously by both the orthopedic and ID services. Both services continued to follow the patient on this admission. The patient was continued on 6 weeks of IV antibiotics (last day of cefazolin [**2203-12-5**]), although the dose was decreased to 1g q6 because of a low white blood count. SEVERE TRICUSPID REGURGITATION: Pt with known grade 4 TR and flail leaflet which he deveoped after acute bacterial endocarditis roughly 10 years ago. We restarted his lasix and spironolactone on this admission. HCV: HCV viral load checked, and found to be 1.5 million. No further therapy initiated. ANXIETY: Pt with history of anxiety and on Klonapin at home. His home regimen was continued. ESOPHAGEAL CANDIDIASIS: Patient was found to have thrush on EGD. He was started on a course of fluconazole given his immunosupressed state. He is being discharged to complete a two week course of anti-fungal medication.

      "Admission Date: [**2152-10-2**] Discharge Date: [**2152-10-11**] Service: MEDICINE ONCOLOGY HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is an 81-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma with known metastases to the liver and lung who status post resection in the 90s with recurrence in [**2146**] status post treatment with Taxol. She presented to the Emergency Room on [**2152-10-3**], with altered mental status, decreased p.o. intake, confusion and headache over several weeks, and was found to have three mass lesions in her brain on head CT. The patient was started on Decadron, as well as Dilantin. In the Emergency Room she became hypertensive and was sent to the SICU. She was maintained on Nipride GTT. In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was weaned off Nipride and then changed to Labetalol, Hydralazine. The patient was also noted to have cellulitis on her left knee and was initially maintained on Vancomycin and later changed to Keflex. The patient was also evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it was decided that the patient would received a total of seven treatments of whole brain radiation therapy in conjunction with Decadron, as well as Dilantin. During her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient had increased alertness and was more oriented, although she does have a history of baseline dementia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Metastatic melanoma status post resection in [**2138**] with recurrence in [**2146**] status post treatment with Taxol. History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation in the past. Status post PCM for sinoatrial dysfunction.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a home health aide. Husband died three months ago. She walks but recently was unable to do so. She otherwise has a very close family. FAMILY HISTORY: On maternal side there is a history of diabetes, as well as hypertension. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 96.5??????, blood pressure 161/47, pulse 74, respirations 14, oxygen saturation 98% on 2 L, 92% on room air. General: She was elderly, lying in bed. She was sometimes agitated and not following commands. She was nonverbal. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements intact. Dry mucous membranes. There was poor dentition. Neck: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. Heart: Regular, rate and rhythm. There was an early systolic ejection murmur, 3 out of 6. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Good bowel sounds. Extremities: There were bilateral skin eschars. The left knee had excoriation and was erythematous. Neurological: The patient was obtunded and not following commands. She had a limited neurologic exam. Cranial nerves II, III and IV intact. She was moving both hands with appropriate strength. No lifting of left arm off bed. Right lower extremity with decreased strength, apparently chronic secondary to polio. On the left lower extremity, she moved toes and feet. LABORATORY DATA: On admission her white count was 6.4, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 269, neutrophils 73, 22 lymphs, 3 monos; INR 1.1, PT 12.7, PTT 27.8; sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 36, creatinine 1.8, baseline 1.4-1.5; platelet count 151; calcium 10.6, magnesium 1.9, phos 3.1, CK 116, MB 5, troponin 0.04; Albumin 4.2; TSH 2.9; urinalysis with occasional bacteria, trace ketones, 30 protein. Electrocardiogram was paced, lateral T-wave inversion, inferior T-wave inversion which new consistent with [**2152-6-23**]. Head CT showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and left parietal lesion with significant edema. There was a small amount of peripheral density, question of hemorrhage or calcification. Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt failure. Knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and degenerative changes with small right knee effusion. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Altered mental status: This was felt to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain. The patient was evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it was decided that the patient would receive a total of seven treatments of whole-brain radiation therapy. Additionally she was maintained on Decadron, as well as Dilantin. The patient had no seizure activity while in the hospital. She tolerated her Decadron well and tolerated her whole-brain radiation therapy without any complications. The patient was discharged on a Decadron taper. Her Dilantin dose was increased to a total of 300 three times a day, given that her Dilantin level [**Company 2240**].i.d. was only 8. The patient will need her Dilantin level followed as an outpatient at her next appointment. 2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures while in the Emergency Room were noted to be 200/100; however, once she was transferred to the floor, she maintained very good control on a combination of Clonidine, Hydrochlorothiazide and Minoxidil, Hydralazine, as well as Labetalol 400 b.i.d. The patient's blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to 160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an appropriate range given that the patient needed to have adequate perfusion in the face of increased intracranial pressure. 3. Cellulitis: The patient was initially maintained on Vancomycin, and this was later changed to Keflex. The patient did not develop any rash or other complications Keflex. Her cellulitis was improved by the time of discharge. 4. Renal insufficiency: Her creatinine remained at baseline between 1.4-1.5. 5. Coronary artery disease: The patient was maintained on enteric coated Aspirin, as well as Labetalol. The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her electrocardiogram remained stable without any EKG changes. 6. FEN: The patient was maintained on a soft diet, as well as thin liquids. She tolerated this without event. Additionally her electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted as needed. Her I&Os were monitored closely. 7. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient is paced. She was rate controlled. She was held off all anticoagulation given her metastatic disease to the brain. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to her home because her family wanted the patient to do so. The patient has [**12-27**] full-time nurses that will be following her once she is discharged to home. Her mental status improved greatly while the patient was in the hospital. By the time of discharge, the patient was conversive and much more alert and oriented. Her neurologic exam was significant for intact cranial nerves and the ability to move all extremities spontaneously. She did have limited movement in her arms, given that she has a history of bursitis. Otherwise, the patient's exam neurologically was much improved. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. She was stable on room air. She could not ambulate without assistance and does need help with all bed transfers. She was tolerating a p.o. diet without problems. [**Name (NI) **] mental status had improved considerably in that she was conversant, could move her extremities spontaneously, and cranial nerves were intact. Her strength was notable for weakness throughout but was symmetric. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, lung and brain. 2. Hypertension. 3. Hypercholesterolemia. 5. Osteoarthritis. 6. Bursitis. 7. Cellulitis. 8. Chronic renal insufficiency. 9. Coronary artery disease. 10. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. DISCHARGE STATUS: As stated above, the patient will be discharged to home with [**Hospital 2241**] nursing care.

Pt is currently somnolent and unable to provide a detailed history, so details are obtained from OMR and Atrius records. Pt saw NP in complex care clinic on [**7-10**], at that time felt well overall, c/o dry cough but denied SOB, peripheral edema. At that time her weight was recorded at 185 lbs (dry weight is estimated at 184 lbs). On [**7-17**] she called the CCC office c/o minimal urine output (\"only drops\") and cough productive of yellow sputum. She reported compliance with her home diuretic regimen, but [**Name8 (MD) **] NP note she had not filled her aldactone rx. . On DOA, she called EMS due to increasing SOB. When EMS arrived her SBP was 80. She received 250cc NS and was brought to ED. In ED she had SBP 90s so received another 500cc NS bolus. CXR showed no e/o infiltrate but she was treated empirically for CAP with 1g ceftriaxone given her recent productive cough. Labs were significant for Na 121 and Cr 5.4 (baseline 3.5-4.0). She was admitted to medicine service. On the floor, her BP was initially 98/65 but then decreased to SBP 70s. She was transferred to CCU for pressor support. . On transfer, vitals were T 95.7, HR 60 (v-paced), BP 110/56, RR 18, O2sat 100% on 2LNC. She was drowsy, but denied current SOB, chest pain, palpitations, LE swelling. She endorsed orthopnea (c/w baseline) cough productive of yellow sputum, nausea, RUQ discomfort, and anuria. Denied recent fevers/chills, diarrhea/constipation, melena/hematochezia, BRBPR. . Of note she was admitted 1 month ago (from [**Date range (1) 2266**]) for CHF exacerbation and hypervolemia. She was started on a lasix drip with metolazone but was ultimately started on ultrafiltration with a tunneled HD line which she tolerated well. She has not required outpatient HD since discharge.

Pertinent Studies ECHO [**5-/2194**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) with regional variation, the apical segments more hypokinetic than the basal segments. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial effusion. . CXR [**2194-7-18**]: There is a left-sided pacemaker/ICD with right atrial and right ventricular leads, as before. Severe cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. Pulmonary venous congestion is seen without definite interstitial pulmonary edema. No focal consolidations are seen. There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. There is minimal right basilar atelectasis. . HD Labs: - Iron studies: Iron Binding Capacity, Total 433 (nl 260 - 470 ug/dL) Ferritin 29 (nl 13 - 150 ng/mL) Transferrin 333 (nl 200 - 360 mg/dL) - PPD: negative . Discharge Labs: Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), AICD p/w SOB and poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia, now transferred from medicine to CCU due to hypotension. . Active Issues: . #Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient was hypervolemic on exam with elevated JVP and increased abdominal distension at presentation. Given the patient had been refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic therapy. She experienced significant muscle cramping and hypotension while on CVVHD requiring dopamine. CVVHD was discontinued on HD#2 and she was diuresed with IV lasix and metolazone. Pressures improved and she was weaned off of dopamine. It was noted that urine and blood pressure improved when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with asynchronous ventricular pacing. Therefore the patients pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native rhythm and the mode was changed to AAIR. Despite this change urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis. On HD#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter, and on HD#7 she continued HD using the tunneled line (see below). Lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient will be HD dependent. . #Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive on admission in the setting of volume overload. Her hypotension was believed to be due to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated cardiomyopathy. She was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this was weaned by HD#2. In addition, she experienced episodes of hypotension with CVVH with diuresis and antihypertensive medications, so her antihypertensive medications were held. On discharge, her BP was stable. She was asked to continue to hold her carvedilol and to follow up with her PCP about restarting as tolerated. . # Hyponatremia: Pts sodium was 119 on admission and likely cause of her AMS, thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia with poor renal perfusion given e/o volume overload on exam and low urine Na. Her fluid intake was restricted to 1.5L daily, and she started CVVH as above with improvement in her hyponatremia as well as her mental status. At the time of discharge her sodium was 135. . # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient was noted to have a creat of 5.4, baseline 3.5-4.0, and oliguria x 2-3 days on admission. As stated above she had previously required ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbation. Renal was consulted and felt that the patient would require chronic HD. Given her hypotension she was initally started on CVVH with dopamine gtt for pressure support. However as above she did not tolerate CVVH and it was discontinued. She was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as above until she had her tunneled line placed on HD#6. She tolerated HD well, with stable BP and no muscle cramping. Outpatient dialysis was arranged with [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center for mondays, wednesdays and fridays. . # Afib: Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin at home. On admission her coumadin was held in preparation for placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. As stated above her pacemaker settings were changed and she was in sinus rhythm for most of her CCU course with heart rates in the 50-70s. Her mode was changed to AAIR to allow for intrinsice AV conduction and minimize ventricular pacing in an abnormal heart. Her coumadin was restarted at her home dose on HD#7. Her INR at the time of discharge was 1.4. # Stable issues: . # COPD: Patient's recent cough and SOB with h/o COPD was initially c/f COPD exacerbation, and she was initially started on prednisone and levofloxacin. However there was no wheezing on exam therefore prednisone and antibiotics were discontinued. She was continued on her home albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments, and maintained O2 sats >90% on 2L NC (her baseline O2 requirement). . # CAD: Stable, no c/o chest pain during hospitalization. She was continued on her home ASA and pravastatin. . # HTN: Carvedilol was discontinued due to frequent episodes of hypotension (with SBP 70s-80s). She can resume as an outpatient if BP tolerates. . # Gout: Patient was continued on her home allopurinol and did not have any pain concerning for a gout flare. . # Transitional issues: - Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization. - She will continue outpatient hemodialysis at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis Center - She has follow-up scheduled with her PCP and her cardiologist. She will be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding a follow-up appointment with the device clinic in 3 months.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the hospital. You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and not making urine. Your heart was not pumping well which caused you to have extra fluid. We gave you medication to help you to urinate out this fluid however your kidneys were not working properly and you needed dialysis to do the job of your kidneys. You got a special IV to be used for dialysis. You will need to continue going to dialysis three times a week. Your blood pressure was also so low so we did not give you your home blood pressure medications while you were in the hospital. You should continue to go to dialysis three times a week. You were also started on a medication called nephrocaps that you will need to continue. You should stop taking your carvedilol, metolazone, spironolactone and lasix unless your doctor instructs you to restart these medications. Continue your coumadin and amiodarone for your abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation). Continue your aspirin and pravastatin for your heart disease, your allopurinol for your gout, your albuterol and ipratropium for your COPD.

His initial Hct was 28 and initial INR was 15. He was admitted to the ICU and resuscitated. He was transfused 2 units of PRBCs for a Hct of 22, and 2 units of FFP to reverse his anticoagulation. He was also given Vitamin K. The following day he was transfused 4 more units of PRBCs. The GI service was consulted and 2 attempts were made to do a colonoscopy. Both attempts were aborted due to a poor preparation. After 3 days in the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 2303**] Hct was stable at 26-27. He was transferred to the floor and given 1 more unit of PRBCs for borderline urine output. His Hct then stabilized at 28-29. Since he had no more episodes of bloody bowel movements, it was felt that there was no need to make further attempts at colonoscopy. His diet was then slowly advanced, physical therapy evaluated the patient, and he was discharged to rehab on HD 7. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] from GI as well as his PCP regarding his coumadin dose and INR checks. At the time of discharge he was placed on coumadin 1mg Qhs (h/o PE and cardiac thrombus) and his INR was 1.4. His Hct was 28.7.

Because of significant blood loss, you were stabilized throughout the admission with transfusion of blood products and clotting proteins. You underwent colonoscopy to evaluate for source of the bleeding. It not only showed multiple areas of sick colon consistent with your Chron's disease, but also a non-bleeding ulcer in the bowel. Multiple biopsy's were taken, results pending. The most likely cause of your bleeding is your very low ability to clot due to a reaction between your blood thinner coumadin and the asacol which you started. Both medications are being stopped, and only restarted after discussion between your PCP and your Gastroenterologist. After being evaluated by Physical Therapy, it is felt that you would benefit from a short stay in an acute rehab facility to help improve your strength after this hospitalization.

Overall LV systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls, and extensive apical akinesis. There is no VSD. RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. AV leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but AS is not present. Mild (1+) AR is seen. MV leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no MVP. Mild (1+) MR is seen. LV inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated PA systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

This lesion is amenable to further evaluation by targeted ultrasound, possibly with biopsy, as clinically indicated. 2. Vague 1.3 cm lesion in segment 7 on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**] is not clearly visualized. However, this examination is motion limited and a small lesion within this vicinity cannot entirely be excluded. 3. Filling defect in the lower common bile duct suggests choledocholithiasis without evidence of acute obstruction. [**2131-7-6**] CT chest/abd/pelvis w/ w/o contrast 1) 3.7 cm irregular soft tissue mass at the lateral aspect of the ascending colon, associated with lymph nodes, corresponding to the colon cancer seen on colonoscopy. Small amount of fluid along the right paracolic gutter, probably due to biopsy. 2) Featureless appearance of the descending and sigmoid colon, with increased wall thickening and fat stranding in the descending colon, suggestive of active inflammation due to Crohn's disease. 3) Ill-defined 1.3 cm lesion in the segment 7 of the liver, for which metastasis is suspected given the colon cancer.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-2-11**] 10:44 AM IMPRESSION: Diffuse hazy opacities within both lungs, without evidence for volume overload. Findings are most concerning for a diffuse infectious process, likely with atypical organisms. If the patient is immunocompromised, PCP should be considered. Brief Hospital Course: On admission there was high index of suspicion for PCP given the appearance on chest x-ray and a significant amount of oropharyngeal thrush. Bronchoscopy with BAL on [**2190-2-12**] was positive for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was presumptively started on Bactrim and Prednisone treatment in the emergency department. She was consented for HIV testing and it came back positive with a viral load (VL) of 114,000 and a CD4 of 8. Her oxygenation was tenuous initially requiring face mask with desaturation to the high 70 with movement to the commode but she did not require intubation. Over the course of her treatment she was transition ed to face tent and eventually to 4-5 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. Her overall oxygenation minimally improved very slowly despite Bactrim with a prolonged steroid taper. She was finally discharged home with O2 supplementation of [**3-2**] L to keep O2 sat at 94 % at rest. Her hypoxia was related to the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]. For confirmation, she underwent CTA of the lung which was negative for pulmonary embolism. The CT did show diffuse ground glass opacities as well as lymphadenopathy without effusions consistent with the diagnosis of PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2321**] her exertional hypoxia, she remained well with minimal symptoms (only mild dyspnea with activity but no significant cough and no fever or chest pain). Patient remained in the hospital for several extra days hoping that her hypoxia will improve. It did remain stable at the above level without any additional symptoms (4-5 L at rest with O2 sat at 94 with decrease to 87-85 with activity. Without oxygen, her O2 sat will decrease to 76 with activity). In regards to the new diagnosis of AIDS(AIDS defining illness and CD4 of 8), her toxoplasma IgG was positive. She was started on azithromycin for [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis. ID was consulted and will follow her closely as an outpatient ( 3 days after discharge). HIV genotyping was sent and was pending at the time of discharge. The patient has a history of hypertension and was continued on home dose of Atenolol 50 mg daily. BP was well controlled despite holding amlodipine/chlorthalidone and these were NOT restarted on discharge. She did have elevation of her liver function tests on presentation. Work up included negative hepatitis serologies and RUQ ultrasound (mild fatty infiltration). LFTs abnormalities were related to PCP pneumonia, fatty liver, or both. Blood AFB culture and HCV viral loads are pending and will be followed by her ID. She was discharged home without VNA, the latter would offer little help as she had no to minimal symptoms. Total discharge time 56 minutes.

The airway is narrowed to 4mm at the level of the hyoid. Patent cervical vasculature. . CXR ([**2105-4-17**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. No pathologic mediastinal widening. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pulmonary edema. . CT neck and chest w/ contrast ([**2105-4-18**]): 1. Interval slight decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid collection and improved airway patency. 2. No evidence of Lemierre's disease or new abscess formation. 3. No evidence of extension of the fluid collection into the mediastinum. No evidence of mediastinitis. . Chest CT ([**4-22**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Rapidly enlarging multiloculated right pleural effusion. This could be due to empyema considering clinical suspicion for this entity, but definitive diagnosis would require correlation with thoracentesis results. 2. Small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in size since the prior study but does not have loculated components. 3. Slight increase in size of pre- and sub-carinal lymph nodes as well as right hilar nodes. These are likely reactive. 4. Ground-glass opacities in left upper lobe which are likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology. . TTE ([**4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal.

Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with PMHX of HTN presenting with sore throat, neck pain, and odynophagia found to have epiglottis and retrophargyneal phlegmon. . #Epiglottis/retropharyngenal phlegmon: Diagnosed on CT neck and by ENT scope. Symptoms consistent with this. The patient did improve clinically with steroids, Ceftriaxone and clindamycin. The patient's airway was closely monitored in the ICU and underwent repeat ENT scoping on [**2105-4-18**] that showed ongoing arytenoid edema but completely patent airway. Repeat CT neck and chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous lesion (see below), did not show Lemierre's or mediastinitis. There was minimal interval improvement in the phlegmon collection, however. Blood cultures from admission were positive for GNRs, later grew out HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE. Planned for 14 day course from day of first negative culture. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and re-evaluation by ENT in the ICU showed improved of supraglottic swelling so she was transfered to the floor. Repeat cultures were negative ???? HIV was sent and was negative. Patient continued to be symptom free on the floor and did not have any further airway complaints or problems. She was treated symptomatically with cepacol lozenges and was kept on a nicotine patch and received nebulizers PRN. . #Erythematous lesion: Patient developed a 3X3 inch erythematous lesion on her anterior chest, 2 inches below cricoid and poorly demarcated. The patient endorsed feeling warm and mildly tender to palpation in this area with no pruritis. No plaques/papules/bullae. The lesion was very blanching. Dermatology was consulted on [**2105-4-18**] given spread of this lesion to ~4X4 inches despite broadening to Vancomycin. Given the timing of her antibiotics, this lesion was not felt due to drug eruption, although a very early drug eruption can not be ruled out. The erythema was felt most consistent with a toxic exanthem, which is a vasodilation that occurs in patients with bactermia (more often staph, strep). Supportive care was provided. Derm followed patient while in house. by hospital day 4 the rash had significantly receeded. Derm did not feel compelled to biopsy - they thought it was likely due to her infectious process but did not represent a cellulitis. Her rash improved later in her hospital course. . #Pneumonia and pleural effusion: She was noted to have intermittent hypoxemia and R sided pleuritic chest pain on [**4-20**]. Medicine was consulted on [**4-22**], and in setting of new moderate pleural effusions R>L on CXR, recommended chest CT, which showed rapidly expanding and loculated effusion on R. She was then transferred to medicine, and ID was consulted. Her antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. Her pleural effusion was attempted to be drained by IR, but they only withdrew 30 cc of fluid, given loculation. Thoracic surgery was then involved and carried out a VATS procedure which was uncomplicated and the patient was transferred back to medicine. . #Hypertension: Blood pressures normal and intermittently high (SBPs 150s) in-house. The patient's atenolol, lipitor were held in the setting of epiglottis/retropharyngeal phlegmon but restarted once she was able to tolerate POs. Atenolol was initially started at half home dose 50mg, then back to her full dose.However due to asymp. bradycardia into the 40's atenolol was discontinued ad replaced with Chlorthalidone on [**4-25**]. . # Intermittent bradycardia to 40s, asymptomatic: She was monitored on telemetry with occasional intermittent bradycardia to the 40s. her EKG was otherwise normal, without AVB. TTE was done which showed no HD significant pericardial effusion, abscess, or vegetations. Her bradycardia may have been due to vagal tone in setting of pleural effusions and pleuritic pain. . # Lower extremity edema: She noted increased edema during this admission. She had some baseline edema as a flight attendant but only while standing for long durations. She had no JVD or HJR, and TTE was normal. . #PPX: Heparin sq #Full Code, confirmed.

He had 1. Exploratory laparotomy. 2. Pancreatic debridement with wide drainage. 3. Open cholecystectomy. 4. Placement of a combined G/J tube (MIC tube). Post-op he stayed in the ICU for 2 nights and was trasnfered to the floor on POD 3. GI/Abd: He was NPO with a NGT and IVF. The NGT was removed on POD 2. His G-tube was left to gravity drainage. His J-tube was capped and then trophic tubefeedings were started on POD 2. His tubefeedings were advanced to a goal of Replete with Fiber 3/4 strength at 80cc/hr. He had 3 JP drains in place and these were draining thick, dark fluid. He continued to have high output from these drains. He was started on sips on POD 5, he was advanced to clears on POD 6. JP amylase was checked on POD 7, once on a full liquid diet. His JP Amylase was 27K, 34K, and 14K. He was made NPO due to his JP amylase reported as high. He continued on the tubefeedings. A grape juice test was positive for a leak from around the JP drains. He had one small spot with minimal drainage that could be expressed from his incision. His is now having drainage around all his drains and g/j tube with mild skin irritation. He has irritation around the tube extending out from ~0.5 - 3 cm and appears at [**Doctor First Name **] to develop yeast. His midline incision is c/i but has a small amount of serous drainage on the gauze. Have suggested using Criticaid anti fungal moisture barrier to protect his skin from the drainage and to prevent the formation of yeast. Continue to apply a thin layer of dressing around the drains and change as needed do not allow the gauze to become saturated with drainage. Apply the antifungal Criticaid two to three times/day. A CT was obtained on [**5-5**] and showed: 1. Heterogeneity in the region of the pancreas consistent with the patient's previous necrotizing pancreatitis. 2. Three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization from the small bowel into this residual collection. 3. Loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring 16 cm. 4. Gastrojejunostomy in situ. 5. Renal cysts. 6. Bilateral pleural effusions. 7. Enlarged prostate at 8 cm. . He will remain NPO with TF for 2 weeks and then return for a repeat CT. His drains will remain and the drainage will be monitored. Pain: He had good pain control with a PCA. He continued on a PCA thru POD 6. Once back on a diet, he was ordered for PO pain meds with good control. Labs: We monitored his labs and his Tbili decreased from a high of 2.6 on POD 2 to WNL by [**2198-4-28**]. Cards: He was being followed by his PCP/Cardiologist. He was put back on his home meds on POD5, including Lasix IV for gentle diuresis and his heart meds. Renal: He was diuresing well and continued to have negative fluid balance and losing weight appropriately.

The patient also reported recent fever and chills. In the ED, patient had a low grade temperature of 100.5 degrees. Her abdomen was slightly distended, with no rigidity or rebound. Admission laboratory data were notable for WBC 6.2, elevated transaminases, and INR 3.7. Right upper quadrant ultrasound disclosed a 5 mm gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. There was also a 5mm gallstone in the common bile duct, without ductal dilatation. The patient was evaluated by surgery for her choledocholithiasis. The patient was also seen by the ERCP fellow. The patient was not acutely ill last night, so she was admitted to the Medicine team, with plan for ERCP today. She was kept NPO and was administered IVF overnight. This morning, she was administered 4 U FFP to reverse her INR. After receiving 2 U FFP, she became hypoxic, with O2 sats dropping to the 70s. She was placed on 100% NRB with improvement in her O2 sats to the 90s. Prior to dialysis, she was given 100 mg IV Lasix, with urine output (non measured). At 1:50 PM, she was transferred to the Hemodialysis Unit for initiation of hemodialysis. Approximately 1 L was removed, yet the patient remained in respiratory distress, with O2 sats in the low 90s on NRB. At 2:30 PM, a respiratory code was called since patient's O2 sats dropped to 70s on the NRB. The patient was emergently intubated. ABG prior to intubation was 7.21/55/55. EKG disclosed new ST segment depressions in the inferior and lateral leads. Following intubation, the patient's SBP dropped to 80s. She was administered approximately 500 cc NS bolus, and required Dopamine transiently. The patient was transferred to the MICU for further management. Past Medical History: 1.

[**First Name (STitle) 2371**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2372**] Brief Hospital Course: 1. Respiratory Failure: On HD#2, the patient developed acute respiratory distress. The patient had recieved IVF in the ED the nigtht before and that monring had recieved 4 units of FFP for planned ERCP, the last two within one hour of respiratory distress. CXR demonstrated acute developement of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Ddx included cardiogenic pulmonary edema versus TRALI. The patient was taken for emergent HD; however, depspite succesful diuresis, the patient required intubation for respiratory failure. TRALI work-up is pending at the time of discharge. The patient remained intubated in the MICU and succesfully extubated on the second attempt. 2. Hypotension: After intubation, the patient became hypotensive in the MICU requiring initiation of pressors. She was found to be adrenally insufficent by cortisyn stimulation test and started on stress-dose hydrocortisone and fludircortisone. In addition, she required pressors and continued IV Unasyn for possible sepsis, though blood cultures were negative. The patient's blood pressure improved and stablized. 3. Choledocholithasis: Demonstrated on admission RUQ US on admission without transaminitis but with low-grade fever and left-shift. The patient was evaluted by Surgery and ERCP service. She was started on IV Unasyn. Patient underwent ERCP in MICU while intubated, which demonstrated dilated CBD but no stones. Patient had spinchterotomy. The patient completed a 10 day course of IV Unsyn and will be discharged on two days. Consideration should be given to possible outpatient cholecystetomy. 4. GI Bleed: Post-ERCP, the patient dropped Hct and was foudn to be guiac postitive. Patient underwent repeat ERCP which demonstrated spincterotomy bleed. This required epiniephrine injection. Hct remained relatively stable, though she had a possible rebleed several days later which stablized without repeat scope. ASA and coumadin were held [**2-3**] bleed and may be safely restarted on [**2127-8-4**]. The patient's Hct remained stable for the rest of her hospital course. The patient will continue on her PPI. 5. Coronary Artery Disease: During the patient's MICU stay, EKG was noted to have poor R wave progression. An echocardiogram was obtained which demonstrated regional LV dysfunction suggesting CAD. Cardiac enzymes demonstrated non-diagnostic elevated Tropnin T, felt either secondary to demand or ESRD. ASA was held [**2-3**] GI bleed and the patient's beta-blocker was continued. The patient will need an outpatient evaluation of her coronaries, likely with ETT MIBI when she is stable. Again, ASA will be started [**2127-8-4**]. 6. ESRD: The patient did well on her hemodilyasis schedule. The patient's prednisone was continued for her history of renal vascultitis. 7.

Per her daughter, the patient was home this past week and accidentally took trazodone 50 mg two days prior to admission, which had been discontinued due to confusion. Her confusion/visual hallucinations improved the day prior to admission. She complained of increased productive cough and oxygen requirement (previously intermittent 2L NC, now continuous) over the past two days, responding to an increase in nebulizer treatments. The patient was noted to be lethargic this afternoon, responsive to sternal rub. When aroused, she was oriented x 3 and moving all extremities well, however. The patient was noted to be \"cold.\" She has not complained of recent fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema around line. . In the ED, initial VS T 96, HR 63, BP 77/55, RR 18 SaO2 98% (oxygen not documented). Per report, patient had poor respiratory effort, became apneic, and was subsequently intubated. Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and left lower lobe pneumonia. Head CT negative for acute process. A right femoral line was placed for access. She was given etomidate and roccuronium for intubation, vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1, zosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1, 1L NS. The patient was started on levophed for hypotension peri-intubation, off within half an hour. . On arrival to the MICU, she is responsive to tactile stimuli.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical history of COPD, Wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease, recent admission [**Date range (3) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella pneumonia and sepsis. 1)Moraxella pneumonia: Most likely explanation for respiratory failure/hypotension in ED requiring intubation. She was successfully extubated on [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2 via NC without e/o respiratory distress. Her sputum culture from [**2131-12-24**] is again growing Moraxella, no other new organisms. CXR continues to show same LLL infiltrate concerning for partially treated pneumonia. Concerning for endobronchial lesion with postobstructive pneumonia however chest CT did not show any underlying structural cause for recurrance of pneumonia. She did have bilateral pleural effusions which appeared simple and did not appear to be parapneumonic. She was initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn however this was changed to ceftriaxone once culture data returned with moraxella. She improved daily from a repiratory standpoint and was on minimal to no oxygen on discharge. She was changed to cefpodoxime on discharge to be given only on hemodialysis days, after dialysis as this antibiotic is renally cleared. 2)Altered mental status: Likely delirium in the setting of infection, sedating meds, ICU stay especially in setting of advanced age. In addition, daughter reports that she took trazodone two days prior to admission, which has caused confusion in the past. She had a CT head on admission without acute process. Her mental status cleared during her hospital stay and treatment of pneumonia. 3)Coagulopathy: Her INR was 2 on admission, however climbed to peak of 5.3 likley due to poor nutrition and antibiotics. Her coumadin was stopped [**12-25**] and held throughout the remainder of her admission. She was restarted on 1mg coumdain on discharge with INR checks with dialysis. Her INR was 2.9 on the day of discharge. 4)Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis. Decision made to initiate HD last admission. She was dialysed for volume overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for dialysis at FMC - West Suburban Dialysis Center. She was continued on epogen with dialysis, nephrocaps, calcitriol, calcium. 5)Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission; prior to that was in the low 30s. No signs or symptoms of active bleeding, guaiac negative. She was transfused one unit PRBC with dialysis on [**12-26**] with stable hematocrit around 26 throughout the remainder of her hospitalization. She should be continued on epogen with dialysis. 6)Diarrhea - patient has developed diarrhea in setting of multiple admissions and antibiotics. She had one stool that was negative for C. diff and was started on loperamide to decrease stool output given skin breakdown. She was also advised to eat yogurt three times daily. Diarrhea is most likely antibiotic associated due to alteration of normal bowel flora, however she will require two additional stool samples to rule out C.diff. She will require monitoring of in's and out's and encouragement for oral intake to prevent dehydration. 7)Skin Breakdown: During her admission she began developing skin breakdown on her gluteal cleft likely due to a combination of immobility due to acute illness and diarrhea as discussed above. She will require close monitoring of her skin and frequent personal care to keep her buttocks clean and protected. 8)Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Her metoprolol was initially held in the ICU given sinus bradycardia and sepsis. It was resumed at home dose on [**12-26**] however given borderline blood pressures, it was decreased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-27**]. 9) Spiculated lesion on CT chest: as discussed in radiology report, will need repeat CT in 3 months to reassess this lesion for stability. 10)Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 11)Code: Full 12) Comm: [**Name (NI) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 46**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2373**], daughter/HCP Medications on Admission: Medications: 1.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Type 2 diabetes with triopathy, endstage renal disease secondary to diabetes, status post cadaver transplant in [**2182**], history of coronary artery disease, status post CABG in [**2178**], history of peripheral vascular disease, right ankle fracture in [**2188-6-6**], with an open reduction internal fixation, status post hardware removal, chronic osteomyelitis. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS: Percocet, dicloxacillin 100 mg twice a day, gabapentin 1600 mg twice a day, Lasix 20 mg twice a day, Sensipar 30 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg daily, ranitidine 150 mg daily. There are two other medications that the patient is on, of which the handwriting is not decipherable at this time. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a nonsmoker, is married and lives with his spouse. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs 94.6, 94, 18, blood pressure 144/88, oxygen saturation 93% in room air. Blood sugar fingerstick was 291 on admission. General appearance: Alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress. HEENT exam: Mild right eye ptosis. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or carotid bruits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Chest is with a well healed median sternotomy incision. Heart is a regular rate and rhythm with a systolic ejection murmur II/VI, nonradiating. Abdomen is soft, nontender, obese. Extremities: Right malleolus with punctate lesion with draining and surrounding erythema. Pulse exam shows palpable radial pulses, femoral pulses bilaterally. The right DP and PT are dopplerable signals. The left DP and PT are dopplerable signs. Neurological exam is nonfocal. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the vascular service. His dicloxacillin was continued. Vancomycin and Flagyl were instituted. He was continued on his preadmission medications. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and advisement was made for him to undergo a below the knee amputation. The patient accepted the recommendation. Transplant nephrology was consulted to follow the patient during his hospitalization. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for hyperglycemic management. Daily SK5 levels were obtained. He required minimal adjustment in his immunosuppression. He continued on his Lantus with a Humalog sliding scale with improvement in his glycemic control. On [**2189-12-3**], he underwent a right BKA without incident. He was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. At the end of his surgical procedure intraoperatively, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 60s and he was given Neo 200 mcg x2 and epinephrine 5 mg x2. The patient went into a monomorphic VT 4 minutes at a rate of 130. He was given lidocaine 100 mg IV bolus and amiodarone 125 mg over 15 minutes. The patient converted to sinus rhythm. An intraoperative TEE showed severe biventricular failure. Dopamine was started at 5 mcg/kg/minute. Blood pressure improved. He was transferred to the PACU and then to the ICU for continued care. Serial enzymes were obtained. Repeat echo was obtained on the 28th which demonstrated left ventricular wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained by 2-D images. He has severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. He had multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. His aortic valve was moderately thickened leaflets. There were no masses or vegetations on the aortic valve. No aortic insufficiency. The mitral valve, tricuspid valve were normal with trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. The pulmonic valve and artery were unremarkable. The pericardium showed no pleural effusion. Aortic valve area was calculated at 1.3 cm squared, normal is 3 cm squared. Gradient peak was 32 mm. There was no intracardiac thrombus noted on the primary or the secondary echo. The ejection fraction was calculated at 30% to 40%. IV heparin was begun to maintain a goal PTT between 40 and 60. The patient's Dobutamine was weaned with hopes to extubate. Pulse exam remained unchanged. The right amputation site was clean dry dressing. He remained on bedrest in the SICU. Cardiac enzymes: Base was 20, peaked at 96 for the CK. CK MBs were not obtained. His troponins were 0.01 and 0.03. The patient's Swan was converted to a CVL on [**2189-12-4**]. The patient continued on heparin, was extubated and transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care on [**2189-12-5**]. Cardiology was requested to see the patient on [**2189-12-6**], who felt the patient was hemodynamically stable and his atrial fibrillation was rate controlled. We should continue the heparin while his INR is less than 2 and his goal INR should be [**1-9**], and recommend metoprolol tartrate twice a day versus single dosing. They recommended aspirin 81 mg and simvastatin 20 mg daily. Hyperglycemia control remained relatively good. He did not require adjustment in his Lantus. His premeal coverage was adjusted. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were discontinued on [**2189-12-7**]. The patient remained afebrile. Foley was discontinued. Peripheral line was placed and the central line was discontinued. The patient had been advanced to a regular diet and ambulation to chair was begun. On [**2189-12-8**], postoperative day 5, the patient continues on IV heparin/Coumadinization conversion. Serial coags were monitored. Physical therapy will see the patient and make recommendations regarding disposition planning, being a new amputation if he will go to rehabilitation. Will talk to infectious disease, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2379**], regarding discontinue the doxycycline. The remaining hospital course, the patient will be discharged when medically stable and bed available at rehabilitation. At the time of discharge, discharge medication instructions will be dictated.

In [**11-16**] he had elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent. Mid-RCA was 80% occluded and treated with DES as well. In [**2-18**] pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft. His plavix was discontinued at that time. He was recently admitted on [**2188-4-30**] w/ STEMI over III, F, taken to cath, where he had a DES placed in the LCX for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus proximally. Of note, at cath [**4-30**], he had a totally occluded right external iliac artery. The pt was discharged home [**2188-5-3**]. Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery, bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night. He stated he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he developed a \"cold rough\" feeling in his esophagus similar to his pain that he had with all of his prior MIs. He states it was a [**5-24**] in severity. He took 1 nitro, and it resolved. He reports he did not take his plavix yesterday and today. He noted intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which felt like \"gas pain\", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting. He states the feeling returned and then persisted, took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a [**2192-2-16**]. He called 911. . In the ambulance, the pt's pain decr to [**1-25**] and he received ASA, another nitro en route. His pain, however, only resolved completely on nitro gtt at OSH where he was given ASA, IV integrillin, IV heparin, started on nitro drip with full resolution of pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. His initial BP at OSH 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro. Outside labs with CK 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, BNP 17. . At [**Hospital1 18**], he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath. In the cath lab: LCX was totally occluded within proximal stents. A wire was passed and flow was reestablished (likely development of blood clots). 1 additional bare metal stent (no DES since he had questionable compliance w/ plavix) placed distal to last stent. Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches. Cath was performed via radial artery (per lower ext arterial disease). His right groin (femoral vein) developed a hematoma. His left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post surgery 2 months ago. He was subsequently transferred to the floor. He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath HCT). He is being transferred to the CCU for unstable HCT and hematoma with labile BP s/p catheterization today. . Brief CCU event: CT scan of abd neg for RP bleed. Neg groin for psuedoaneurysm.

Pt was then found to have a hematocrit drop and hypotension necessitating transfuse to CCU, now stabilized. . Blood loss: Pt was s/p catheterization with R wrist for arterial access and R groin for venous access. CT scan was performed, and ruled out RP bleed and U/S ruled out AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm. He received a total of 3 units PRBCs in CCU, and his hct has been stable. Pt likely had blood loss during cath, and in groin hematoma. After being transferred back to the floor from the CCU, his Hct was stable. Low-dose metoprolol was started the night before discharge, and he tolerated this with SBP in the 100s to 110s. . Cardiac. Patient was admitted with a repeat STEMI secondary to instent thrombosis. He had placement of a bare metal stent, and was started on higher doses of plavix at 150 mg daily. He was continued on aspirin and a high dose statin as well. His antihypertensives were held due to hypotension, and restarted prior to discharge. He was not diuresed further, despite an elevated PCWP of 28 at catheterization, due to hypotension. He remained in normal sinus rhythm. . Hyperbilirubinemia: the pt was noted to have mild jaundice and scleral icterus on [**5-12**]. LFTs were checked and his total bilirubin was 6.6, direct bili was 0.2. His other LFTs were normal. His hemolysis labs were normal. The hyperbilirubinemia was felt to be most likely due to either reabsorption of the large hematoma or a side effect from one of his HIV meds, most likely atazanavir. His bilirubin continued to climb but he was otherwise asymptomatic. A RUQ U/S showed small gallstones but no evidence of cholecystitis or obstruction. His statin and HIV meds were stopped on discharge. . HIV: Patient was continued on his outpatient HIV medications. He was continued on prophylactic bactrim. He was continued on his antidepressants. .

In the ED, T 98.4 (rectal), HR 101, BP 102/53, RR 20, O2Sat 98% on 3L. Incontinant of guaiac-positive stool. Treated with 4 L NS, vanco 1g IV, ceftazadime 1g IV, and flagyl 500mg IV. Received 0.5 mg ativan and 2mg IV morphine for agitation. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she completed a 10-day course of ceftazadime and vancomycin for urosepsis. A 7-day course of metronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C. Diff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count, although all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and was transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of transfer, active issues were poor nutritional status, thrombocytopenia and anemia. On the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib with RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation. There was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she had pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt digoxin was not recommended. Pt was therefore readmitted to the MICU. While in the MICU, she was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam as she had (1) sites of possible infection at the erosions under her breasts and on her right hip, as well as question of PNA, (2) rising WBC, reaching a high of nearly 17. MICU course was also marked by (1) hypotension, which responded to gentle NS boluses; (2) low UOP believed to be [**2-22**] both hypovolemia and a low baseline nitrogenous load/obligate urine output; and (3) recurrent Afib, for which she was transitioned to amiodarone 400mg PO daily, to run for 7 days before titrating downward.

Routine PA and lateral films are recommended for evaluation when feasible. [**1-10**]. Echo. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Based on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data. Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change. Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially admitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with hypotension and AFib with RVR. # Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with many family meetings reagarding goals of care. On [**2194-1-21**] the patient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU transfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the patient. The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**]. She was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care. Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**]. The family declined autopsy. # Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to 150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous conversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses and bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape. Digoxin considered unfavorable in this patient. In the MICU, pt was started on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO. When the patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having increased pauses up to 20 seconds. Her amiodarone was stopped. # Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and thrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be secondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused total of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**]) with a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10. Transfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**]. Also, the patient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total of four units since [**2194-1-12**]). # Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to fluid blosues of 250 cc. ECHO demonstrated impaired LV relaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for distributive shock. Once no longer fluid responsive, she was started on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off. She was again hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary to systemic vasodilation. She was started on levophed but a decision was then made to not escalate care. # Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious sources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions under breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA). Vanc and piptaz started on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not obtainable at this point. CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff neg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**]. Now with GNR from skin swab. # Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since admission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been getting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have not been able to keep up her free water intake. # Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline on admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to infection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after resolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process. Thyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick euthyroid syndrome. # Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient developed labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for hypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema. Diuresis with furosemide gtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated respiratory distress. On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a witnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask. While in the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had increasing O2 requirements. # Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on admission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of 0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due to sepsis. Later in her hospital course, the patient was hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought secondary to ATN. # Hypothyroidism: Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg IV daily (half home dose). T3 low. TSH elevated. Resumed home dose 1/4. # Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural effusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low albumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake. Diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed above. Continue to monitor. # Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis requiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were positive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime x10 days. Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast, which was not treated. Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew out yeast. # Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan. There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head secondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable destruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and surrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain is being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches. # Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to agressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and hypoalbuminemia. Was difficult to effect a significant diurese in MICU due to development of hypotension in response to furosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**], unchanged on [**1-20**] CXR. # Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no interventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration causing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic count and no evidence of hemolysis. No further treatment per oncology. # Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency. Encourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags. Medications on Admission: Medications on Admission: 1.

He had a midline ventral hernia, which was soft. Liver was palpated 2 cm below the costal margin. The patient was OB positive in the Emergency Department. Extremities revealed 1+ pedal edema with venostasis changes bilaterally. Skin examination had no rashes. The patient s alert and oriented times three with a chronic left foot drop. INITIAL LABORATORIES: White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit 31.4, which then dropped to 24.3, baseline is 41. Platelets 138. SMA 7 notable for a sodium of 136, K of 4.7, bicarb 24, BUN 32, creatinine 0.5, glucose 158, INR 2.3. Dilantin level was 3.0. ALT 35, AST 51, alkaline phosphatase 203. Total bilirubin .5, LDH 215, albumin 3.0. Enzymes were cycled, which were negative. The patient's electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR prolongation at 206. Left axis deviation, inferior Qs, all of which were old. There were some new T wave flattening in V2 to V6. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient was admitted with melena likely an upper gastrointestinal bleed given history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, question of enteric fistula. Given history of hemochromatosis and early cirrhosis, question of varices, given history of reflux symptoms, question of esophagitis, gastritis. The patient was again admitted with gastrointestinal bleed and was typed and crossed. He was initially transfused 2 units for a hematocrit of 24. He had two peripheral intravenouses in place. INR was corrected with vitamin K 2 mg and 4 units of fresh frozen platelets and hematocrit revealed a change from 24 up to 26 after 4 units. INR corrected to 1.7. The patient was also started on Protonix 40 intravenous b.i.d. Aspirin and Coumadin were held. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the following morning, which revealed grade 1 esophageal varices and mild gastritis esophagitis as well as portal gastropathy. There was no active bleeding at any site. The patient then underwent an abdominal CT, which was negative for aortic enteric fistula. On the following day the patient underwent a colonoscopy, which was normal up until the ascending colon. However, they were not able to go all the way to the cecum and recommended virtual colonoscopy in the future and the patient had then underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding times four to the esophageal varices. The patient will need a repeat banding procedure in ten days. After the banding the patient was started on Sucralfate 1 gram q.i.d. and was continued on Protonix. Again aspirin and Coumadin were held throughout. After 4 units hematocrit stabilized from 24 up to 32 and remained stable at 32 upon discharge. 2. Hypotension: The patient was initially in the systolics in the 90s likely hypovolemic in the setting of a gastrointestinal bleed. However, given the history of cardiac disease the patient's enzymes were cycled times three, which were negative. He was resuscitated with fluid, fresh frozen platelets and packed red cells and blood pressure remained stable throughout. After the esophagogastroduodenoscopy the Atenolol was switched to Nadolol given the history of cirrhosis and varices and Zestril was held up until discharge due to low blood pressures. 3. Coronary artery disease: Patient with a history of myocardial infarction in [**2180**] and [**2182**] and is status post stent of the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2182**]. Enzymes were cycled, which were negative. Aspirin and Coumadin were held due to gastrointestinal bleed. Beta blocker and ace were initially held due to low blood pressures. Lipitor was held secondary to new cirrhosis. The patient was restarted on Nadolol upon discharge, however, aspirin, Coumadin, Zestril and Lipitor were held prior to discharge to be restarted by primary care physician at his or her discretion. 4. Deep venous thrombosis: Patient with recurrent left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, but admitted with gastrointestinal bleed. INR 2.3, Coumadin was held due to multiple procedures and held upon discharge. The patient will undergo repeat banding in ten days after which time the patient may or may not resume anticoagulation per primary care physician. 5. Hemachromatosis: The patient with hemachromatosis for long standing, now with evidence of cirrhosis on examination. The patient will continue with further phlebotomies as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and may need further workup for cirrhosis. 6. History of abdominal aortic aneurysm: Patient ruled out enteric fistula with negative abdominal CT. 7. Seizure disorder: The patient was given additional dose of Dilantin 400 times one and then restarted on his regular does of 300 and will continue on his regular dose. No further seizure activity. 8. Diabetes: The patient was initially held NPO diabetic medications due to NPO status. Was covered with a sliding scale. Sugars remained stable and can restart Glyburide upon discharge. Metformin held secondary to cirrhosis. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Esophageal varices s/p banding. 2. Portal gastropathy. 3. Gastritis esophagitis. 4. Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis. 5.

The patient had a past medical history significant for hypertension, glaucoma, and breast cancer treated with lumpectomy, XRT in [**2176**]. She was in her usual state of health until [**12-2**] when she began to note shortness of breath. She saw her PCP and performed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray, which revealed a right upper lobe density. This was followed up with a CT scan, which revealed a lobulated mass of 2.3 cm in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe and bilateral lobe interstitial fibrosis. Follow-up PET scan was nondiagnostic. The patient had a mediastinoscopy, which showed no evidence of malignancy or lymph nodes. Lung biopsy was performed, which revealed pulmonary fibrosis. Subsequent spirometry revealed a mild restrictive defect. The entire picture was thought to represent UIP. On [**2182-2-18**], she presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 2142**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea times several days. In the waiting room, she developed presyncope. She was urgently brought to the trauma bay, there her heart rate was in the 30s with the EKG revealing a junctional rhythm. Her SBP was in the 80s. Attempts made to place a temporary pacing wire but during the procedure the patient suffered respiratory arrest. She was intubated and resuscitated, and a line was successfully placed. Subsequent labs revealed a potassium of 9.8. The patient was treated with calcium bicarb, insulin, and glucose and admitted to CCU. In the CCU, the patient was started on Levophed and dopamine for hypotension. Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to evaluate her hypotension and revealed an SVR of 2473 with a cardiac output of 2.2. Two hours later, the cardiac output was 6.5 and SVR was 898 after pressors were weaned down. Urgent TTE revealed normal systolic function, no pericardial effusion. Potassium dropped to 4.3 after 1 day. The patient was empirically treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for hypotension, which was thought possibly due to sepsis. By hospital day 3, she was off pressors, her white blood count was 16.1. She was successfully extubated, and her potassium remained normal. By hospital day 4, she continued to have mild respiratory distress despite being extubated. She was thought to be in mild CHF. She was diuresed. Levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued for possible pneumonia. By hospital day 5, she developed worsening respiratory distress, and the patient agreed to elective intubation. She was then transferred to the MICU for further workup and care. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension. Glaucoma. Breast cancer. UIP. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Verapamil. 2. Propranolol. 3. Tamoxifen. 4. Xalatan eye drops. 5. Betoptic eye drops. 6. Calcium carbonate. 7. Aspirin. 8. Folate. 9. Vitamin E. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission to the MICU, temperature 98.9 degrees, blood pressure 126/61, and pulse 108. The patient was sedated and intubated. Her lungs revealed diffuse crackles bilaterally. Cardiac exam was within normal limits. Abdomen was benign. Lower extremity revealed no edema. PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA: On admission to the MICU included a white count of 21.9, hematocrit of 29.3, and platelets of 85. Chest x-ray on admission to MICU revealed persistent bilateral upper lobe patchy opacities, may represent interstitial edema plus aspiration. Continued patchy atelectasis within the left lower lobe and small left pleural effusion. CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with presumed diagnosis of sepsis. Subsequently, she developed a picture consistent with ARDS and required multiple pressors. After several days in the CCU, she was on 3 different pressors and was unable to maintain her blood pressure. She was requiring increasing ventilatory support. A discussion was held with the family who decided that the patient will be made DNI/DNR due to the fact that CPR was likely to be unhelpful if the patient arrested. On [**2182-2-28**] at 03:15 p.m., the patient was pronounced dead. The family was at the bedside. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Expired. DISCHARGE STATUS: Expired. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: None. FOLLOW UP PLAN: None. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Septic shock. Respiratory failure. Hyperkalemia causing cardiopulmonary arrest.

Right lower lobe pleural thickening is grossly stable. Bullous changes denoted by relative lucency in the right upper lobe are again noted and unchanged. Prominent right mediastinal - paratracheal soft tissue remains unchanged. Left lung is clear. Heart is not enlarged. The aortic contour is grossly unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Minimal interval increase in opacification of the right mid - lower lung is better evaluated on subsequent CT from same day. [**2-12**] CTA Chest: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Right lung volume loss could be due to a congenital anomaly or pulmonary infection early in life. 3. Persistent area of round atelectasis in the right lower lobe with increased size slightly since [**2166**]. 4. New subpleural septal thickening in the left upper lobe and medial basal left lower lobe, new since [**2166**] and suggestive of an interstitial fibrosis. 5. Mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node. Given the pulmonary interstitial findings and mildly enlarged lymph node, followup high-resolution CT is suggested, preferrably in 3 months if not needed earlier. [**2-14**] Transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function. This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary pulmonary process, e.g., pulmonary embolism. Brief Hospital Course: In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99.5 P109 BP101/56 R24 79% on RA on presentation, 100% on NRB. Labs notable for WBC of 5, HCT 34.5, sodium of 131 and creatinine of 1.0. Patient was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin, nebs, and methylprednisone. He had a CXR which was possibly suggestive of RML pneumonia, and a CTA that showed no signs of PE but did reveal some increased interstitial markings in the RUL and RLL, more consistent with a chronic process vs. pneumonia. the patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring on [**2-12**]. He had in past refused CPAP for his OSA but accepted it and reported he had an unusually restful night. He was transferred to the medicine floor on [**2-13**]. # Hypoxia: His increased cough and the CT and chest Xray imaging were most consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia with underlying chronic pneumonic process, and he will need another high-resolution chest CT in 3 months to evaluate progression of these findings. In the ICU, he continued antibiotic treatment for CAP. He did not receive further steroids. He had an Echo that showed RV enlargement, free wall hypokinesis & moderate elevation of PASP. Although these findings were consistent with possible pulmonary embolism, he had a CTA on admission that was negative for PE. Pulmonary was consulted and felt his right heart findings could be related to his underlying known chronic lung disease and sleep apnea rather than PE. After discussion with his PCP and pulmonologist, he was discharged to have a repeat sleep study performed and follow-up TTE in 1 month. Patient was encouraged to start using home CPAP. # Hyponatremia: He was noted to be mildly hyponatremic at admission, possibly due to salt-wasting from his HCTZ use. This mild hyponatremia resolved with a liter of normal saline. # Obstructive sleep apnea: He is now agreeable to trialing CPAP. He was told he should have an outpatient sleep study as above. # Normocytic Anemia: His hematocrit was slightly lower than recent baseline, and iron studies were consistent with chronic inflammation. This will be further worked up as an outpatient.

History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o F with history of nephrotic CRI, renal artery stenosis, and CHF, who presented with hypertensive emergency and heart failure. The patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission. At that time, her BP was 220 systolic @ home and she noticed mild SOB. On the night prior to admission, she developed increasing SOB. Per the patient's daughter, she had been taking her medications as prescribed. She denies chest pain throughout this time. She was brought in by daughter to [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation and was found to have BP 202/40 with a K of 5.9. She was treated with kayexalate 30, lasix 40 IV, clonidine 0.3 mg PO X 1, and levoflox 750 mg IV x 1. . The patient was initially admitted to the floor, where she was found to have the following vitals: 98.3 226/68 68 90% 5LNC (mid 80s on 2LNC), 96% on face tent, RR > 40. As she was acutely dyspneic and in acute failure, she was given 100mg IV lasix and Diuril (on the advice of Renal consultants), w/ good effect-> UOP 350cc in ~1hour. She did not receive any nitrates or morphine at the time. On MICU evaluation was 99% on shovel mask, but still RR>40. Appeared comfortable, JVP ~9 cm. At that time, she denied HA, visual changes, CP, urinary changes, no abd pain, N/V/D. In the MICU, she was aggressively diuresed and placed on her usual blood pressure regimen. Overnight [**Date range (1) 1873**], she did not receive all of her blood pressures meds as her BPs were in the 110s/120s overnight. She did receive all doses of clonidine and hydralazine on [**5-9**]. . Her daughter tells me that her edema is less than usual, but that her right leg is chronically larger than the left. She has been using several pillows to sleep at home. She denies PND. She is not on supplemental O2 at home. Generally BP at home is 170s (per PCP 160s in office at baseline). . Pt was diagnosed with w/ RLL PNA by her PCP and tx [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ levofloxacin X 10 days about 4 weeks ago. Since that time, the daughter has been living with the pt X 3 weeks.

[**2194-5-8**] ECHO: TTE Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). . There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. . There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] . The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. . There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-9-19**], borderline mitral stenosis is now evident. The mitral regurgitation, which is almost certainly underestimated on this study, is probably increased. . [**2194-5-11**] CXR TWO VIEWS: Comparison with the previous study done [**2194-5-9**]. There is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary edema. The mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Streaky density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental atelectasis. There is a moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion. An underlying right basilar consolidation cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged.

She was admitted to the medical floor but immediately was sent to the MICU for respiratory distress. There she was agressively diuresed and then returned to the medical floor. . * Hypertensive Emergency: Her HTN is likely secondary to her ESRD. The elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. She was given blood pressure medications to help control her BP within the range of 130-160 as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion. Her baseline BP is reportedly 160 at home. Ultimately she was placed on clonidine 0.2 mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID, norvasc 10mg qday, metoprolol 12.5mg TID, lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. . * ? SVT: During her initally presentation, she did have some runs of SVT noted on telemetry. Once she was diuresed no further episodes were noted. She was continued on metoprolol 12.5 mg TID for given episodes of ? SVT. . * Congestive Heart Failure: Likely from worsening renal failure and hypertensive urgency. She was agressively diuresed in the MICU with IV furosemide overnight and then with PO furosemide on the medical floor. She was also continued on hydralazine for afterload reduction. . * Renal Failure: A renal consult was obtained. They felt that there was no acute needs for dialysis at present although they have been discussing starting HD with the patient and her family for a while now. This discussion was continued throughout the admission and the patient and her family were resistent to starting. They agreed to meet with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in the next two weeks to discuss getting a tunnelled cath and starting HD. Throughout admission, her electrolytes were monitored closely as she had boughts of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis. These were controlled with standard measures. . * Hyperkalemia: Received Kayexalate in ED. Usually takes kayexalate twice a week as outpatient, so this was restarted as an inpatient. . * Anemia: Baseline Hct appears to be 29-33 and now 25. Iron 45, ferritin 149, TIBC 269 in [**3-5**]. Per renal recommendation, she was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**2194-5-12**] without complications. . * Bacteremia: WBC count 10 on admission and down to 6.4 today. Has been afebrile but blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles with staph coag negative- likely contaminant. Before speciation returned, she was treated with vancomycin dosed by level. Once it was found to be coag negative staph, the vancomycin was discontinued.

The patient's dialysis catheter became dislodged [**8-12**]. Consequently she missed her normal dialysis session [**8-13**]. On [**8-14**] she had a new tunneled catheter placed, but was not dialyzed. The afternoon of [**8-14**] her daughter noticed that the patient seemed increasingly dyspneic and was hypertensive to 200's. She was given hydralazine and clonidine and the BP improved to 160's. She called her daughter ~3am on [**8-15**] due to worsening dyspnea. The patient denies any accompanying headache, vision changes, chest discomfort, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, cough, weakness or loss of sensation. EMS was called, and she was given CPAP with some relief of her dyspnea. Per her daughter, similar symptoms have occurred 3 times in the past. In the ED her vitals were BP 258/61 RR 28 O2 100% on CPAP, 89% on room air (temperature was not recorded). She was started on a nitroglycerin drip, and given calcium and bicarbonate for a potassium of 7.1. She was weaned off NIPPV, with O2 saturation of 97% on 3L NC. She was subsequently transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and dialysis. Past Medical History: 1) Hypertension 2) Stage V chronic kidney disease, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**]. 3) Diastolic CHF (EF 60% on TTE in [**5-3**]), likely volume related in the setting of her renal disease. 4) Rheumatic fever, with the following valvular abnormalities: Mild aortic stenosis, moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral stenosis, mild to moderate MR, mild TR. 5) Severe PA systolic hypertension 6) Renal artery stenosis: MRI [**2185**] atrophic R kidney, moderate stenosis of R renal artery, L renal artery normal. 7) Peripheral vascular disease: Has claudication. 8) Right cephalic vein DVT in [**6-/2193**] 9) Colon cancer in [**2-/2192**], status post resection. 10) Hyperlipidemia 11) Right bundle branch block 12) Anemia of renal failure 13) Osteoarthritis 14) Osteopenia 15) Glaucoma Social History: Lives at home, usually alone, but recently the daughter has moved in with her.

Left lung base atelectasis are noted. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There is a right lung base opacity obscuring the right-side cardiac border which may represent right middle lobe atelectasis vs. pneumonia. Pprominence of the pulmonary vasculature is noted, consistent with mild CHF. The osseous structures are unchanged. IMPRESSION: 1. Right middle lobe atelectasis vs. pneumonia. 2. Mild CHF with small left- sided pleural effusion. [**8-15**] EKG Sinus bradycardia at 56bpm, left axis, old RBBB, peaked T's that are new compared to [**2194-6-24**] EKG. Inverted T in V3 on [**6-2**] EKG has flipped to positive. No signs of acute ischemia. Brief Hospital Course: 1. Dyspnea - The patient's dyspnea was thought to be secondary from volume overload, occuring in the context of ESRD and a missed hemodialysis session, as well as hypertension leading to flash pulmonary edema. Her dyspnea following hemodialysis. 2. Hypertension - The patient's hypertension is also likely related to volume overload. Her blood pressures improved following dialysis and resumption of her home course of toprol, clonidine, amlodipine, and hydralazine. 3. Hyperkalemia - The patient's potassium normalized following dialysis. 4. ESRD - Renal following, on dialysis MWF. 5. FEN - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps. Medications on Admission: 1.

Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with diffuse ground-glass haziness throughout the lungs compatible with pulmonary edema. The right hemidiaphragm remains somewhat elevated and overall low lung volumes are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation. There are no large pleural effusions and no sign of pneumothorax. Hilar engorgement is compatible with congestive heart failure. Bony structures appear intact. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema. LHC [**2198-7-23**]: 1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal without any angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions. The stent in the proximal LAD had diffuse 60% in-stent restenosis. There was 80% stenosis throuhgout the proximal LCX, with a 60-70% stenosis at the origin of the OMB. The RCA had a 100% proximal stenosis with prominent left-to-right collaterals. 2) Resting hemodynamics showed elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and an LVEDP of 27 mmHg. The peak gradient over the aortic valve was 14 mmHg. Using the Gorlin equation, the [**Location (un) 109**] was calculated to be 1.1 cm2, indicating moderate aortic stenosis. 3) Left ventriculography was deferred. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Moderate aortic stenosis. 3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 4. Needs diuresis prior to cardioversion. 5. Consideration for AVR-CABG. LENI [**2198-7-24**]: negative for DVT Carotid U/S [**2198-7-24**]: Panorex [**2198-7-24**]: Brief Hospital Course: The patient underwent the usual preoperative work-up. Dental examined the patient and recommended extraction of one tooth. The patient refused. The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2198-7-25**] where the patient underwent AVR (tissue), CABG x 3, resection of left atrial appendage with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. He does have a history of heart failure with an EF of 30% and initially required multiple inotropes and vasopressors. He remained intubated due to pulmonary congestion, which improved with diuresis. Rapid a-fib developed and amiodarone drip was initiated. This was discontinued when rate was controlled. He failed a trial of Precedex. He self-extubated and was re-intubated without incident. He developed a leukocytosis and was started on cipro for a positive urinalysis. There was no growth on culture, and cipro was discontinued. Tube feeds were started on POD 3. He was extubated on POD 4. By this time, all vasoactive drips had been weaned. Coumadin was resumed for chronic a-fib. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication. Beta-blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the pre-operative weight. ACE Inhibitor was not initiated due to a rise in Creatinine, which would start to trend down prior to discharge. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD #10 the patient was ambulating freely, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. Due to upper and lower pole serosanguinous sternal drainage, Mr.[**Known lastname 1884**] was placed on prophylactic antibiotics x 1 week per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].

She was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 1919**] for a supratherapeutic INR of 16. She was in AF with a ventricular rate of 110s-140s, asymptomatic. Medical management of her AF was initially tried. She was maintained on her atenolol and propafenone, and diltiazem was added. The decision was then made to pursue cardioversion instead. TEE-DCCV was performed on [**2112-4-21**]. She was in sinus rhythm after the procedure and had a HR in the 50s on atenolol and propafenone upon discharge. The diltiazem had been discontinued secondary to bradycardia post-procedure. She was also discharged on Coumadin 1mg qhs. Her family states her symptoms began just prior to discharge, when she began to feel short of breath and fatigued. Her symptoms progressively worsened at home. She was seen in [**Company 191**] the next morning and was found to have O2 sats in the 80s, so she was sent to the ED. . In the ED, her T was 100.6, HR 70s in NSR, and she was 84% on 4L. Her CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions and vascular engorgement, and her INR was 9. She received a Combivent neb, Lasix 20mg IV, levofloxacin 500mg IV, and vitamin K 5mg SC. She was intubated for hypoxia. Repeat CXR showed improvement in pulmonary edema after Lasix. She was admitted to the CCU for further management of hypoxia due to possible CHF. Past Medical History: 1. Atrial fibrillation: diagnosed [**2102**], on propafenone x several years, started Coumadin [**4-11**], s/p TEE-DCCV on [**4-21**] 2. Hypertension: on enalapril and atenolol Social History: No EtOH, no past or present smoking hx, no illicit drug use. Lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 86**], has 1 daughter.

EKG: NSR at 72, normal axis and intervals, T wave flattening in aVL, peaked Ts on V3-V6, no ST segment changes . CXR: continued moderate-to-severe pulmonary interstitial edema with bilateral pleural effusions, no evidence of pneumothorax . TEE ([**4-21**]): The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular cavity size, and systolic function are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. . Stress echo ([**9-25**]): Good functional exercise capacity. No ECG or 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload. Mildly blunted hemodynamic response to exercise. Mild mitral regurgitation. Limited study. Target HR not achieved. Brief Hospital Course: . # Dyspnea: Her shortness of breath and respiratory failure were thought secondary to pulmonary edema. The pulmonary edema likely followed an indolent course, with her rapid atrial fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction causing progressive volume overload. Her acute exacerbation was likely due to post-cardioversion pulmonary edema. She initially had a low-grade fever, but pneumonia was thought less likely, and her chest x-ray was without infiltrate. She had normal cardiac enzymes, so ischemia was not a contributing factor. She was maintained on a beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor. After aggressive diuresis, she was weaned off mechanical ventilation quickly. Diuresis was continued with prn IV Lasix, and she had resolution of her dyspnea and oxygen requirement. . # Atrial fibrillation: She was in sinus rhythm on admission, and was initially maintained on propafenone and metoprolol. On [**4-23**], she converted to atrial fibrillation and had a rapid ventricular response in the 140s. She underwent DC cardioversion, after which she became hypotensive and bradycardic, requiring transient treatment with dopamine. She was continued on propafenone after the DCCV. On the morning of [**4-26**], she converted into atrial fibrillation again, with rates of 140s. She had a normal blood pressure and some mild palpitations. She was initially loaded with po amiodarone, with slowing of her heart rates to the 100s to 110s. When her heart rate began to trend up again, she was loaded with IV amiodarone and started on a drip. Her rates remained in the 100s to 110s. She was transitioned to po amiodarone on the night of [**4-26**]. She experienced nausea and vomiting on po amiodarone. She underwent another cardioversion on [**4-29**] but reverted back to atrial fibrillation the next day. She was continued on amiodarone but remained in atrial fibrillation. She went into rapid ventricular response in the 150s on [**5-1**], requiring IV diltiazem to bring her rate down. She was started on po diltiazem, which was quickly titrated up with her heart rate decreasing to the 80s. The diltiazem was stopped the morning of [**5-3**], just before she underwent another cardioversion. She remained in sinus rhythm for the rest of her stay. She was discharged on amiodarone 200mg po three times daily, with a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**]. Anticoagulation as below. . # Elevated INR: INR went from 4 on [**4-21**] to 9 on [**4-22**] with only 1 mg of Coumadin. Last admission was for INR of 16 on Coumadin 4mg qhs. Received 5mg vitamin K SC in the ED. Repeat coags on the floor showed INR of 11, would have expected some decline with SC vitamin K. Her INR decreased to 4.5 with FFP. Her INR then decreased to normal. Hematology was consulted and felt she could potentially have a partial clotting factor deficiency causing her severe sensitivity to Coumadin. Her Coumadin was held throughout most of her stay, and she was maintained on IV heparin. Coumadin was restarted at 0.5mg on [**5-3**] after her cardioversion. Her INR remained subtherapeutic after 2 doses. She was discharged on Coumadin 0.5mg qhs with a Lovenox bridge, with an INR check 4 days after discharge. She is to follow up with her PCP to consider Hematology follow up. . # Code status: FULL CODE. .

ERCP [**2157-2-1**]: Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: Evidence of a previous wide open sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla. Pus was noted at the ampulla. Cannulation: Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification. Biliary Tree: A single 15 mm stone that was causing partial obstruction was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct. The bile duct was dilated to 15 mm. The rest of the biliary tree was normal. Detailed cholangiogram was not obtained due to suspicion of cholangitis. Procedures: A 5cm by 10FR Double pig-tail biliary stent was placed successfully. Impression: S/P sphincterotomy - this was widely patent. Pus noted at the ampulla. Stone at the lower third of the common bile duct, dilation of bile duct to 15 mm, other normal biliary tree. A double pig-tail stent was placed in the bile duct. Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum TTE [**2-8**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Gallstone was not removed because of the patient's tenous condition. The plan will be to repeat the ERCP in one month to remove the stone. Patient was also with bacteremia with E. Coli and Enterococcus likely [**12-21**] biliary source. Patient initially on Zosyn, but because of thrombocytopenia was changed over to Vanco and Cipro. This was finally changed to ampicillin when susceptibilities resulted. # Cholangitis: RUQ pain, fever, leukocytosis with bandemia, AST 979, ALT 723, AP 120, TB 3.5 and direct of 2.4. ERCP was performed and a double pigtail plastic stent was placed. Her hemodynamics remained stable. Blood cultures were positive for gram negative rods, and she was treated with IV Zosyn. Hepatitis serologies demonstrated previous hepatitis A exposure. She developed bacteremia (see below) and will continue antibiotics until [**2-16**]. She will need ERCP follow up in 1 month for repeat ERCP and stent placement. # E. Coli and Enterococcus bacteremia both susceptible to Ampicillin. Pt initially on Zosyn, then changed to Vanco and Ciprofloxacin given thrombocytopenia. ID was consulted and did not recommend cardiac imaging given that the likely source was the biliary tree and surveillance cultures were negative. She was converted to ampicillin and should continue a 14 day course since last negative culture ([**Date range (3) 1933**]). # Shortness of breath likely [**12-21**] fluid overload: Patient was intermittently tachypneic and wheezing and was treated with albuterol nebs and lasix with improvement. ECHO ordered to evaluate for systolic or diastolic dysfunction. She was found to have restrictive filling pressures and elevated [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**].

She was found mildly tachypneic/wheezing with emesis on her gown. It was felt likely that she had an aspiration event with low grade temp However, she was still moving all four extremities and responding appropriately to questions though mildly sedated prior to transfer to the floor. . On arrival to the floor, pt was minimally responsive to sternal rub and did not withdraw to focal stimuli. She was notably tachypneic and eyes were deviated to right side. She was able to track to left with stimuli and would intermittently open eyes to command. Pt had an ABG 7.4/36/92 with lactate of 3.5 and CXR showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. Due to concern for acute intracranial hemmorrhage, she was taken down for a stat CT head. On return to the floor, pt was given narcan without any significant change in mental status. Neuro was consulted for possible acute stroke and within a few minutes, she became more responsive, opening eyes spontaneously. By the time neuro came to bedside, pt was able to verbalize her name and was noted to be using the right arm and had left sided deficit. A CODE stroke was called and pt was taken for urgent CTA head which did not show any vessel obstruction and TPA was felt unlikely to be helpful. Perfusion images confirmed right temporal hypoperfusion consistent with clinical exam and likely right MCA infarct. ICU consult was initiated and pt's guardian was notified. Pt was given Vanc/Cefepime and Aspirin 300mg PR while awaiting ICU transfer. She was lying flat per neuro recs and was noted to be spitting up bilious emesis. Head of bed was elevated and pt was suctionned prior to transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring of airway and management of acute pneumonia. Past Medical History: Hypertension Developmental Delay Mirizzi Syndrome COPD Social History: At baseline, pt lives at a nursing home and is able to feed herself, undress and can transfer from chair to bed but is otherwise wheelchair bound. No smoking/ETOH history documented. Family History: none relevant to this hospitalization.

ERCP [**2182-10-17**] Procedures: A plastic stent was removed. Impression: 2 balloon sweeps were performed with a small stone, sludge and debris removed. A 1.5 cm biliary stricture in mid-CBD compatible with known cystic duct stone and mirrizi syndrome was visualized. A 10 F 5cm double pigtailed catheter was placed. Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum. CXR [**2182-10-17**] IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia with atelectasis or pneumonia at the left base. . CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe intracranial atherosclerotic disease with findings suggestive of decreased perfusion to the right MCA/PCA watershed region. The findings may represent cerebral ischemia in the setting of hypovolemia, hypotension or other causes of decreased cardiac output. . Cardiac Echo: IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with mild symmetric LVH and hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Consequently, there is a mild to moderate LV outflow tract gradient. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. . RUE LENI IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive thrombus in the right basilic and axillary veins at site of PICC line. Clot does not extend more centrally. .

Pt was noted to have emesis on her gown in the post procedure suite with diffuse wheezes and low grade temp. It was thought likely that she had an aspiration event and when she was arrived on the floor, she had a profoundly depressed mental status, tachypnea and fever to 101.9. Further stat work up revealed evidence of aspiration PNA, leukocytosis and elevated lactate. Initial head imaging was unrevealing. However, she became more alert and was noted to have an acute left sided deficit. CODE STROKE was called and CTA/perfusion images confirmed right sided hypoperfusion likely consistent with right MCA stroke. Neuro felt there was no indication for TPA given patent intracranial vessels and on return to the floor, pt was noted to have bilious secretions that she was having difficulty clearing. She was transferred to the ICU for airway monitoring overnight. Pt was called out to the floor when she was able to cough and spit up secretions. She was noted to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, sometimes will respond to commands and other times will not. BP was allowed to autoregulate for the first 72 hrs post event and pt was continued on Aspirin 300mg daily. She was noted to have recovery of left arm function and was answering yes/no to questions. She was seen by PT/OT who recommended ongoing therapy upon return to NH. After discussion with HCP/guardian, decision was made to avoid follow up MRI as it was not likely to change care plan and pt was unlikely to tolerate the procedure. Echo was performed to rule out cardioembolic source which did not show any thrombus. Lipid panel showed LDL in the 93, and Hgb A1c 9.4. She was hyperglycemic during the hospitalization, and she was started on Lantus and sliding scale insulin. . Aspiration PNA: Pt was noted to have aspiration event s/p procedure and was monitored in the ICU for 24hrs given concern for her ability to protect airway . Leukocytosis, lactate and fevers resolved after initiation of Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl. Respiratory status improved and pt had a PICC placed and she completed a course of antibiotics. Upper Extremity DVT- Patient was subsequently developed a DVT associated with the PICC line. The PICC line was discontinued and she was started on Lovenox. Once a PEG tube was placed, she was started on Warfarin for a goal INR of [**2-6**]. Please follow INR closely and titrate prn. She received her first dose of Warfarin 5 mg on [**11-2**]. Aspiration - Pt was seen by speach/swallow on multiple occasions, which she grossly failed with aspiration. She was kept strictly NPO, and she was maintained with IV medications and hydration. A dobhoff was placed for initiation of tube feeds, while waiting to see if she would regain her swallow function. It is/was hoped that her swallow function would improve, especially considering her significant recovery in her left arm movement, however, she did not show significant improvement on serial exams. In discussion with Speech and Swallow, however, there is some hope that she may recover her swallow on a long term basis, and Swallow therapy may help with this recovery. They suggested an approximate 50% chance of recovery to the point of safe oral intake in the long-term. . Diabetes-Pt with uncontrolled hyperglycemia after the initiation of tube feeds. Her lantus and insulin sliding scales were agressively increased. She is being discharged on 70 units of lantus, and a sliding scale. . Mirizzi Syndrome s/p ERCP: Pt with abnormal biliary anatomy who underwent stent and sphincteroplastyon [**10-17**] for recurrent abd pain. She was noted to have an acute rise in transaminases post procedure and these trended down with normal Tbili. Pt was followed by ERCP team while in house. . Developmental Delay: baseline confirmed with her guardian/mother and nursing home. . HTN: held BP meds to allow autoregulation s/p stroke. She was subsequently treated with IV metoprolol, clonidine patch, and IV lasix, with benefit. After obtaining access via PEG, a blood pressure medication regimen via PEG was begun. I expect that she will benefit from further titration of medications as an outpatient. Please note that she was also started on Lisinopril; please follow up lytes in 1 week to ensure she tolerates. . Hyperlipidemia: Patient's simvastatin was held while patient was NPO. This was resumed after obtaining access via PEG. This medication dose was increased to 40 mg for goal LDL <70 considering diabetes and stroke. Please follow up LFT's to ensure tolerating, and lipid profile to ensure she meets her targets. .

Pt had EGD in ED ([**2132-9-5**]) which revealed granularity, friability and erythema in the stomach body, fundus and antrum compatible with acute gastritis (biopsy obtained). Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. Ulcer in the distal bulb. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum. Echo:([**2132-8-23**]) 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2128-8-18**], there has been no significant change. 1. GIB with increased BUN, likely UGIB, however LGIB initially considered as well. Pt had 2 large bore IV's placed. NG lavage was positive as well as stool guiacs. EGD as above. No active bleed noted however ulcer and gastritis likely source of anemia. Ulcer thought to be secondary to NSAID use vs H. pylori. Will treat for H.Pylori if indicated. Pt will follow up with GI. ASA was held secondary to bleed. Losartan was initially held, then restarted at half normal dose. NSAIDs were avoided. Initially given IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] which was then changed to po. Colonoscopy performed was reported to be normal. 2. Cardiac. EKG changes (NSR at 84, Nl axis and intervals, TWI III, TWI V1-V4). Pt was ruled out for MI with three sets of neg cardiac enzymes. She denied CP. ECG changes likely secondary to demand ischemia from severe anemia. She was initially monitored on tele with no events. An echo done on [**2132-8-23**], as above (LVEF>55%). SOB most likely due to discontinuation of lasix for one week in setting of diastolic CHF. Treated with 40 of lasix IV (held off on diuresis intially secondary to concern for GI bld). 3. Resp. CXR done on [**2132-9-5**] without overt evidence of CHF or pneumonia. Findings suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension. She required O2 supplementation during her stay and was noted to have RA sats in the 80's with ambulation likely secondary to PA HTN. She was sent home on supplemental O2. A Repeat cxr was suggestive of pulm congestion. Lasix given as above. 4. DM2. Initially bld sugars controlled with RISS, oral hyperglycemics were restarted prior to discharge. 5.

MR L SPINE SCAN [**2134-2-27**] 10:09 PM IMPRESSION: Spinal stenosis noted at the level of L3-4 and L4-5 as discussed above. . MR BRACHIAL PLEXUS; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN IMPRESSION: 1. Thickening and ill-definition of the right brachial plexus just lateral to the superior ribs and inferior to the subscapularis muscle immediately below the coracoid process, likely secondary to trauma. No mass or hematoma impinging upon the nerves within the axilla or medially. The appearance of the nerves as they course by the proximal humeral shaft fracture is not well evaluated on this study as it is too peripheral. 2. Humeral shaft fracture and hemorrhage within the subcoracoid bursa not completely evaluated on this study. 3. Cervical spine disc degeneration seen on cervical spine MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] thoracic injury seen on prior imaging of uncertain cause. . HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT [**2134-2-16**] 5:46 PM THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HAND: There is diffuse osseous demineralization. There are degenerative changes with no definite fracture. Joint spaces are preserved. THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT WRIST: Alignment is normal. No fractures are identified. There are multiple rounded calcific bodies in the dorsal soft tissues that do not appear to be fracture fragments. THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT ELBOW: Alignment is normal. No fractures are identified. There is an enthesophyte at the posterior olecranon. . C-spine CT: There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture. Bulky calcifications of the posterior longitudinal ligament are identified at the C2-4 levels, likely resulting in moderate spinal stenosis. Multilevel degenerative changes are identified with disc space and osteophyte formation. Bridging osteophytes are identified at C7-T2. The T1-3 processes appear fused. There is marked irregularity of the inferior endplate of T3 and superior endplate of T4 with impaction of these vertebral bodies onto each other and acute kyphotic angulation at this level. These findings are likely chronic. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The lung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute cervical spine fracture. Extensive degenerative changes as described above. . Head CT: FINDINGS: There is hyperdensity along the left frontal vertex that is likely secondary to volume averaging. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major vascular territorial infarction. Hypodensity in the periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia. Small prior infarcts are identified in the right internal capsule basal ganglia and left external capsule. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. . Bilateral Hip films: Degenerative changes with no definite fracture. . CTA: Impression: 1. no PE 2. enlarged pulmonary arteries 3. lymphadenopathy in mediastinum some of which are calcified 4. calcified hilar lymph nodes 5. pulm lymph nodes along major and minor fissures bilaterally 6. fat density structures in liver and stomach . EKG: afib/atach with no ST-T changes. new TWI in III. . TTE [**2134-2-17**] Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion appears normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. . LABS (on admission): .

[**2134-3-8**] 1:17 pm CATHETER TIP-IV Source: L SC. WOUND CULTURE (Pending): Brief Hospital Course: Summary: Briefly, this is a 81 year old Russian speaking woman who presented status post fall. No intracranial bleed. No hip fracture. + R humerus fracture. CT of c-spine showed severe stenosis. She was initially admitted to the medicine service for workup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm following R humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed central cord and Brown-Sequard syndrome and transferred to the neurology service for closer exam monitoring. She underwent R humerus ORIF and C2-C6 laminectomy and fusion on [**2134-3-2**]. A med consult was obtained on [**2134-3-4**] for persistent hypoxia. She was gently diuresed, and had serial ABG's which showed persistent hypercarbia. During the admission, she was also treated with Cipro for a UTI. . Neuro: The patient could not recall the events surrounding the fall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal humerus, displaced, and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness distally in all 4 extremities. On exam she initially was found to have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness affecting arms more so than legs. She also had evidence of a brown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on the right with an upgoing toe, and pin sensation is down on the left, sensory level of C4/T3 anteriorly on the left (where the two dermatomes meet at the top of the breast). She was complaining of neck pain, and had had trouble voiding so a foley was placed. . MRI of the C-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute spinal cord injury with above findings. Read of MRI was: \"Bulky ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2/3, C3/4, and C4/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe spinal canal stenosis.The cervical cord at those levels is deformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic T2 hyperintense signal. There is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of C3 anteriorly.\" She was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain was controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially. She was seen by both neurosurgery and orthopedics for the injury as both services had been alternately covering the spine service in the hospital. Orthopedics also followed her for the broken right humerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ED when a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later proven to be artifactual). . Both [**Date Range **] and neurosurgery agreed that it was safest for the patient to hold off on the spine surgery for at least a week to allow cord swelling to heal before operating. She remained in a hard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next week; the pinprick sensory level retracted to the T12 region for days, then finally seemed to vanish altogether; the proprioceptive changes on the right also resolved. Although the right arm remained weak and flaccid with just [**2-28**] finger flexors and trapezius/shoulder shrug [**2-28**] (initially thought just limited by pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength improved to deltoid [**3-31**], [**Hospital1 **]/tri both 4+ to 5-/5, and wrist and finger extensors 4+/5; finger flexors were also 4+/5. On [**4-9**]: there were no changes in exam. For neuropathic pain, neurontin had been initiated (patient later requested d/c to simplify med regimen). . The weekend of [**2-27**] on morning rounds, a mild right Horner's syndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily rounds. This, along with the flaccid arm, was suggestive of root avulsion on the right (and associated plexopathy). Her neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during hospitalization. . [**Date Range 1957**]: Pt underwent R humerus ORIF and cervical laminectomy (report below), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted for hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pCO2 in high 50's). She has a follow up appointment on [**3-18**] with [**Month/Year (2) **] to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her C-collar can be removed. . Hypoxia/hypercarbia: Pt had hx of severe pulm HTM, likely [**1-28**] PDA. ABG showed mild CO2 retention, ? if this was close to her baseline. Also likely had component of fluid overload, given recent surgery. Pt was gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Narcotics were d/c'd as pt appeared somnolent. O2 was successfully weaned down to 2L NC (pt apparently had been on 2L O2 at home). CTA on admission was negative for PE, and the suspicion for PE was fairly low post-op given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement improved. Therefore, repeat CTA was not done. She was also noted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory status remained stable while on the medicine service. . Status post fall: The original fall was of unclear etiology. The differential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset afib/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness. Less likely include myocardial infarction/ischemia versus pulmonary embolism versus seizure. Also less likely hypoglycemia given timing after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally cleared in setting of increased creatinine. The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe valvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry showed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib. She had no other significant tele events while in the hospital. . Elevated WBC and lactate at admission: unclear etiology, afebrile with negative UA and infectious workup at admission. This cleared on its own. Later in hospitalization ([**2-27**]) she had a UTI treated with course of ciprofloxacin. Urine cxlood cx, and cath tip cx were sent prior to d/c to workup somnolence, however pt's somnolence cleared and cx's were pending on d/c. These should be followed at her follow up appointments. . Musculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative for fracture or bleed including right UE, hips bilaterally, c-spine and head. Patient with known chronic low back pain and sciatica. . Hypertension/pulmonary hypertension: continued ASA, held valsartan. lasix initially held for renal failure but was restarted once she was clinically stable. . Hypercholesterolemia: continued home dose of lipitor . Renal: She has slight renal insufficiency at admission and was given gentle IVF. Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as needed, MVI and continued niferex. ARF improved. She should have her potassium and BUN/creatinine followed at regular intervals starting 2-3 days post discharge, as she was discharged on her home dose of [**Last Name (un) **] and new dose of lasix. Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on TEDS, SQ heparin, PPI, bowel regimen. She complained of RLE pain one day, and u/s was ordered to r/o dvt - this study was negative. .

ASSISTANT: [**Last Name (un) 1965**]. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old woman who sustained a fall and has a displaced right proximal humerus fracture. She also has a spine injury and this has been operated on by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1966**]. Given the displacement of her fracture and that she is having pain and not tolerating nonoperative treatment, we decided to proceed with intramedullary nailing. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1967**] had completed his spinal portion of the case, the patient was placed in the supine position. The right arm was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. A 3 cm incision was made over the proximal humerus and the deltoid was split. Eentry point was established in the proximal humerus and the guide wire placed. The fracture was held reduced and the guide wire passed into the distal humerus. The proximal part of the humerus was reamed and then the canal was reamed up to a size 10 mm. Next a 230 by 10 mm [**Doctor Last Name 1968**] and Nephew nail was placed and interlocked with 2 screws proximally. The distal locking screw was placed under image intensification. Wounds were irrigated and closed with 0 Vicryl, 2-0 and a subcuticular 3-0. Postoperatively, she was brought back to the recovery room in stable condition. COMPLICATIONS: None. As the attending surgeon I was present for and performed the entire procedure.

Per the ED resident, the patient noted that she had had worsening SOB x 2 weeks (documented as 2 days [**Name8 (MD) **] RN note) and also complained of orthopnea and increasing lower extremity swelling and weeping from a venous stasis ulcer on her L shin. The patient was able to communicate this verbally to ER resident (RN notes she was only able to speak in 4 word sentences). Her VNA stated that she was only 94% on 2L O2 at home and had rales [**12-28**] way up bilaterally. On initial assessment in the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, her vital signs were T 98.2, BP 167/60, HR 61, RR 23, sats 100% on RA. On next assessment (2 hrs later), pt was felt to be very SOB while attempting to use the bed pan. RN noted her to be dusky, diaphoretic. HR 72, RR 28, sats 90% on RA. She was placed on a NRB with improvement in her O2 sats to 98%. BP rose to 210/74, then 215/93. CXR was taken and read as c/w pneumonia. Blood cx were obtained and ceftriaxone was administtered. 90 mins later, she was felt to be diaphoretic again, with increased work of breathing. Her O2 sats dropped to 90% by NRB and she was prepped for intubation. She was given 2mg versed and was intubated. SBP 210 -> 178 -> 130. She was taken to CT scan for CTA. On return from CT scan, she was felt to be bucking the vent. She was given fentanyl 100mcg, with resultant drop in her SBP to 77. She was then bolused 1L of NS with improvement in her SBP to 96. She was also given vecuronium 10mg IV and ativan 1mg IV because of inability to ventilate and biting at the tube. . On review, she was given: 1gm CTX IV x1, ? azithromcyin 500mg IV x1, lasix 20mg x1, 120mg succinylcholine IV, etomidate 20mg IV, 12.5mg versed IV, and fentanyl 100mcg x1.

      "Admission Date: [**2136-4-4**] Discharge Date: [**2136-4-9**] Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: fatigue Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R IJ placement History of Present Illness: This is a 84 year-old Russian speaking female with a history of systemic hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic diastolic CHF, who presents with hypotension, drop in hematocrit and guaiac positive stools. She reportedly collapsed 3 times today. Per son, patient felt lightheaded every time she stood up and had to sit back down to the floor. She has never had a problem like this in the past. Denies any NSAID or alcohol use. Denies hematemesis. Occasional blood-tinged stool when she strains, but denies hematochezia. Denies any fevers. Denies black or bloody stools, but stool always black because of iron. Of note, patient was recently admitted and discharged on [**2136-4-2**] with multifocal pneumonia. In the ED, initial vitals were T:98.3, BP:81/20, HR:79, O2 Sat 100% on 4L. NG lavage was negative. Patient received 2 units PRBC and right IJ placed for persistent hypotension. .

She is on 2L home oxygen Family History: NC Physical Exam: Vitals: T:97.3 BP:105/37 HR:88 RR:21 O2Sat:96% on RA GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, pale conjunctiva, no epistaxis or rhinorrhea, dry MM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, 3/6 systolic murmur, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB ABD: Soft, Superficial subcutaneous firm area, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM, EXT: No peripheral oedema. NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time. CN II ?????? XII grossly intact. Moves all 4 extremities. SKIN: Pale Pertinent Results: Laboratories: Notable for Hematocrit of 22 down from baseline 30, WBC 22.5, and creatinine 3.9 up from baseline 1.4. See below for rest. . ECG: Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm with evidence of RVH, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T changes. . Imaging: [**2136-4-4**] Chest x-ray: FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Evaluation is somewhat limited by underpenetrated technique. There is no definite evidence of pneumonia. Heart size is stable. Pulmonary arterial prominence is noted compatible with patient's given history of pulmonary hypertension. Atherosclerotic calcification at the aorta is noted. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse demineralized bone is noted with post-surgical changes of the right proximal humerus. . Abdominal CT:Large right rectus muscle hematoma approximately 10.1x4.4x15.2 cm. . Echocardiogram on [**2136-3-26**]: The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Brief Hospital Course: This is a 84 year-old female with a history of pulmonary hypertension, diastolic CHF, who presented with weakness, hypotension, Guaiac positive stools. . # Hypotension - Her hypotension and anemia were felt to be due to blood loss from rectus sheath hematoma. Unknown exactly how the hematoma occurred (?secondary to heparin injection while recently hospitalized)but was well visualized on the abdominal CT that she had in the ER. She was evaluated by GI (due to anemia and guaiac positive stools), who found external hemorrhoids on exam and stated there was little or no concern regarding duodenal angioectasia as source of hematocrit drop. They followed and plans for c-scope if she started bleeding again. Her Hct was 22 on admission, microcytic. She received 3 units of blood in total and her hematocrit stablized at 29-30 for several days. Her blood pressure was 80/40 on admission and she was admitted to the MICU, but did not require pressors, her BP increased with blood and fluids (2L). In the ICU she was on a po PPI, had two large bore IVs, as well as central access. Her Hct was checked q6 hours and transfusion parameter was 26. Her aspirin was held. Her BP increased to teens over 80's and she was transferred to the medical floor after one day in the MICU. On the medical floor her blood pressure remained in the 120's/80's initially but then increased to 140's. Her lisinopril, valsartan, metoprolol and furosemide were held initially due to her relatively low blood pressure and increased creatinine (see below). Her furosemide was restarted on the last day of hospitalization due to blood pressure that would tolerate it and signs of hypervolemia. In addition she had several bowel movements on the day prior to admission, likely due to many laxatives she was receiving. She did not have a leukocytosis, fever. The stool was guiaic negative. Her laxatives were discontinued except docusate. . # Acute renal failure - Pre-renal secondary to hypotension/hypovolemia. C Her electrolytes and volume status were stable. Her lisinopril, lasix and valsartan were held and continue to be held as her blood pressure is in the 130's. Her creatinine was 3.4 on admission with a baseline of 1.6. Her creatinine decreased to 1.4 after hydration and her lasix was restarted at her home dose of 80mg po bid. . # Leukocytosis - WBC on admission was very high, likely reactive, given hypotension, and acute blood loss. Blood and urine cultures were negative and she had no diarrhea. Her CXR was unremarkable and antibiotics were deferred as there was no source of infection, she was afebrile and her leukocytosis resolved (WBC was 7 for the last two days of admission). . # Hyperlipidemia - She continued to take atorvastatin . # Chronic pain - She continued to take gabapentin . # Diabetes mellitus - insulin sliding scale while in house, once creatinine normalized glipizide 2.5mg q daily was re-started. . # Psych - Continued paroxetine . # PPx: She had pneumoboots . # Code: Full code . # Comm: [**Name (NI) 1961**],[**Name (NI) **] (Son) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1976**] Medications on Admission: #.

Patient reports that since discharge from the hospital on Saturday [**11-21**], she has had persistent increased sputum which she has difficulty coughing up. She feels like the sputum gets caught in her throat. It is white-clear. She denies fever or chills. She denies worsening dyspnea, but has only ambulated in her house as she hasn't been feeling well. She endorses mild orthopnea. She denies worsening lower extremity edema. Of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxia with CXR findings of a LUL. She had presented to her cardiologist one week prior to initial admission with complaints of worsening dyspnea and increased sputum production, without fever or leukocytosis. At that time, cardiologist felt that patient was having an acute flare of her chronic bronchitis, and placed her on a one week course of levofloxacin. A CXR was performed at the time to rule out pneumonia which was negative for consolidation. She followed up with the cardiologist NP one week later, and was found to have O2Sats ranging from 68-80% on 3L NC (baseline, home oxygen). She continued to be afebrile without leukocytosis but reported no improvement in sputum production or dyspnea. She was sent to the ER where a repeat CXR showed bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for pneumonia. She was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the medicine service. Antibiotics were not continued as patient was afebrile, without cough or leukocytosis. Right lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT.

Hospital course notable for acute renal failure. #Hypoxia/Atypical Pneumonia/Pulmonary hypertension/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease/Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure/Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with hypercarbic respiratory which was felt to be due to over oxygenation, and most likely worsening pulmonary hypertension from volume overload and atypical pneumonia. She was diuresed and treated with azithromycin with improvement in her symptoms. She was also seen by the Pulmonary service for evaluation of her pulmonary hypertension and episodes of apnea and they recommended an outpatient sleep study. The patient did well and was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor and improved with antibiotics and further diuresis and was discharged on home oxygen of 2-3L NC. Given that over-ventilation and over-oxygenation was felt to contribute to the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence, the patient should have oxygen for a target oxygen saturation of 89-93%. #Pulmonary nodules: Patient had sputum production and a chest CT which showed 3 left uppe lobe lung nodules that were most likely felt to be infectious. She was ruled out for TB with 3 negative sputa for AFB and patient received course of azithromycin. She should have a follow up CXR in 6 weeks. Patient and son were made aware of this and the importance of follow up. #Acute on chronic diastolic Heart Failure: As above patient was admitted in volume overload. Hospital course was notable for improvement in symptoms with diuresis, but complicated by acute renal failure (see below). Patient was ultimately discharged euvolemic on regimen of Lasix 80mg once daily to keep her euvolemic and TBB even. #Acute on Chronic renal Failure: During diuresis for acute heart failure, patient developed acute renal failure with probable contraction alkalosis. At this point diuresis was stopped, gentle fluids were given, and diuretics were stared when renal function had returned to [**Location 213**]. Lisinopril was held and should be started 3 days after discharge at 2.5mg po daily. # Hypertension: Blood pressure was well controlled on home regimen. Diltiazem was continued but Lisinopril was held during acute renal failure. # Diabetes mellitus: HgbA1c 6.5 in 7/[**2138**]. On glipizide at home. Patient was covered with sliding scale insulin in the hospital. Glipizide can be restarted once renal function stabilizes. # Transitional issues: AFB cultures will need to be followed-up She will need close pulmonary follow-up for repeat imaging in several weeks (fu of pulmonary nodules as well as follow up of her likely COPD, severe pulmonary hypertension, and probable sleep apnea . #Disposition: Patient was discharged to rehab.

Keppra 2,000 mg p.o. b.i.d. 3. Valium 5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4. Neurontin 800 mg t.i.d. 5. Celexa 40 mg p.o. q d. 6. Albuterol nebulizer. 7. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8. Pseudoephedrine 30 mg p.o. q.i.d. ALLERGIES: Phenobarbital, phenytoin, penicillin, Haldol. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 100.0, heart rate 76, blood pressure 132/77, saturation of 100 percent on vent assist control/650/20/5 on 85 percent, not overbreathing, PIP-31. General: Intubated, sedated male, appearing slightly rigid. HEENT: Pupils were 2 cm minimally reactive to light. Lungs: Expiratory wheezes bilaterally. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. Neurological: The patient was sedated, but would withdraw to pain. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Respiratory: The patient was continued on q.i.d. albuterol nebulizations. His sedation was lightened and he was successfully extubated the following day. Admission arterial blood gas was 7.48/39/404. It was uncertain whether or not the patient actually had asthmatic exacerbation. He was initially given Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously. However, this was discontinued the following day. He appeared stable with regard to his respiratory status at the time of discharge. He did not have an AA gradient. Neurological: A Neurology consult was obtained at the time of admission. Since there were no clear jerking or rhythmic movements and since the patient's group home representatives stated that this was not his typical seizure activity, it was unclear whether or not the patient was actually having seizures. At the time of admission, he received 8 mg of Ativan. His outpatient regimen of seizure medications was continued. This included Depakote, Keppra, valium and Neurontin. The patient had no obvious seizure activity during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay. An electroencephalogram was obtained by the Neurology service, which was consistent with encephalopathy, but did not reveal any seizure activity. Levels of valproate were measured and found to be within range. Mental Status: The patient was initially fairly somnolent. However, over the course of the day, he was able to become more alert. A representative from the patient's group home was scheduled to see the patient to decide whether or not he was at his baseline. The patient was able to eat and take his medications without difficulty during his hospitalization. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable. DISCHARGE STATUS: To group home. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Mental retardation. Seizure disorder. Asthma. Depression. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: No changes were made to the patient's outpatient regimen.

On the day of admission, the patient was sitting bolt upright in bed in respiratory distress. He was given Albuterol neb without improvement. At that time his oxygen saturation was 88 percent, and he was intubated for apnea. An initial chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe opacities consistent with aspiration pneumonia. He was extubated on the day after admission. On presentation the patient was febrile and started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia. He was called out to the floor three days after admission. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Seizure disorder secondary to anoxic brain injury. Over the past three months, the patient has had increasing seizure activity from baseline according to his primary caretaker. Mental retardation. Asthma. Depression. Fetal alcohol syndrome. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia. History of positive PPD. Status post fall in [**2188**] with a C7 fracture. History of multiple psychiatric admissions (The patient can be combative and assaultive at times).

FAMILY HISTORY: No seizure disorder. ALLERGIES: Phenobarbital, Penicillin, Haldol. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Upon transfer to the Medical Floor, temperature was 97.9 with a T-max of 101, pulse 83, ranging from 51-126, blood pressure 110/47, respirations 21, ranging from 21-32, oxygen saturation 97 percent on 4 L nasal cannula. General: Examination was significant for a young black male in no acute distress. The patient was awake and responding to voice appropriately. HEENT: Moist mucous membranes. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Neck: Supple. Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2. Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Decreased breath sounds at the bases with a few audible wheezes. Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities: No edema. LABORATORY DATA: White count 6.4, hematocrit 40.5; creatinine 0.9, 1.6. ASSESSMENT: This was a 41-year-old male with mental retardation, recently worsening seizure disorder, on triple medication therapy, admitted with aspiration and probable aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient was treated with a seven- day course of Levofloxacin. He was initially treated with Flagyl; however, this was discontinued before day 7 because of his tendency to decreased seizure threshold. The patient was placed on aspiration precautions. During his hospitalization, he had multiple episodes of unresponsiveness, which were likely post ictal states. In addition, he had multiple seizure activity, and therefore was deemed to unstable to go down for a video swallow. A bed side speech and swallow evaluation recommended ground/pureed food with thickened liquids. The patient tolerated this diet well. In addition, the patient was placed on a quick steroid taper with nebs p.r.n. After starting antibiotics, the patient remained afebrile for the rest of his admission, and his lung examination normalized. He was on room air at the time of this dictation. Seizure disorder: Over the past few months, the patient's seizure disorder has been worsening. Initially on admission, his Keppra dose was decreased to 1500 b.i.d. He was continued on his home dose of Valproic Acid and Gabapentin. The patient had multiple episodes of witnessed seizures, some tonic and two short tonic clonic seizures. These responded to intravenous Ativan; however, on two episodes, he had probable seizure activity with bilateral up and out for more than 20 min. Neurology was consulted. The patient received two EEGs during his hospitalization, both of which did not demonstrate seizure activity. There was generalized swelling, likely due to medication affect. The patient was transferred to the Epilepsy Service for continuous monitoring. Psychiatric: The patient has a history of combative behavior and multiple psychiatric security codes being called. A similar code was called during this hospitalization. Psychiatry was involved and recommended p.r.n. for agitation. Prior to transfer to the Neurology Service, the patient's dose of Keppra was increased back to his home dose of [**2188**] mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient was maintained on seizure precautions. The patient is full code. This portion of the dictation summary was dictated by the General Medicine Team. An addendum will be dictated by the Neurology Service after the patient receives continuous EEG monitoring.

CXR ([**2180-10-29**]): Ill-defined hazy opacities in both lungs, worse within the left perihilar region, with increased size of the cardiac silhouette and small left pleural effusion. Findings most likely relate to pulmonary edema. Underlying infection or neoplasm, as noted on the prior CT within the left lung cannot be discerned on this exam. . TTE ([**2180-10-30**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There is brief right ventricular diastolic compression/collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. Moderate pericardial effusion with echo evidence of tamponade. . CT Chest With Contrast ([**2180-10-30**]): No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Massive progression of disease with substantial generalized severe mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, newly appeared bilateral pleural effusions, newly appeared pericardial effusion, newly appeared multifocal pneumonia, and evidence of lymphangitis carcinomatosa. . TTE ([**2180-10-31**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a very small pericardial effusion which is partially echodense. The pericardium may be thickened but is not well visualized. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-10-30**], the pericardial effusion is now much smaller. . CXR [**2180-11-2**]: IMPRESSION: Further progression of metastatic breast cancer disease with pericardial effusion, extensive infiltrates in left lower lobe, and additional probably metastatic spread in other lung regions. It cannot be decided whether the described findings have any relevance to therapeutically-induced fluid overload. . ECHO [**2180-11-3**]: Conclusions Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion. Bilateral pleural effusions. Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old woman with a PMH significant for metastatic breast cancer with lung and brain metastases admitted originally to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of respiratory distress, then transferred to CCU after pericardiocentesis for cardiac tampoande, then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 2035**] after pt's respiratory status stabilized. . #. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: On presentation to the ICU, the patient denied any fevers but reported a productive cough of several months duration. CXR on arrival demonstrated left peri-hilar and basilar infiltrates with concern for infectious consolidation/pneumonia, pleural effusion or progression of metastatic disease as her cancer was known to be located in the left lower lobe. A CT with contrast was performed to further evaluate the intrapulmonary process and demonstrated a multifocal pneumonia, progression of the pulmonary metastases, pleural effusions as well as a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion (see below for management of pericardial effusion) but was negative for a pulmonary embolism. Given productive cough and radiographic evidence the patient was started on Levaquin and Vancomycin for robust CAP treatment. On review of her medical chart, HCAP was considered more likely and she was started on Levoquin and Cefipime. Blood and urine cultures were performed and showed no growth as well as an Influenza DFA, which was negative. The patient was maintained on oxygen by nasal canula to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 90%. Urine culture showed no growth though UA was positive for leukocytes, as she was already on broad spectrim antibiotics, no additional coverage was added. Antibiotics were changed to Levaquin and flagyl to cover postobstructive pneumonia, she will finish a course of 8 days on [**2180-11-8**]. On [**10-31**], patient spiked fever to 100.9 and cefipime was restarted. After arrival to [**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so Cepfepime was dc'd again. Pulmonary was consulted and per their recs, Vanc was restarted and Flagyl was dc'd after 5 days. Pt ultimately completed 8d of Levoquin and at time of discharge, Vanc was changed to Linezolid to complete the course at home. Cough was treated symptomatically. Pt was discharged with O2 suppl. . #. Pericardial Effusion: Patient was tachycardic on presentation. There was concern that it may be related to the patient's hypoxia or another underlying process such as a PE or possibly hypovolemia. Antibiotics for her pneumonia as above. Intravenous fluids were given for hypovolemia with little change in heart rate. A CT was ordered as above to evaluate further, which was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did reveal a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion. A TTE was ordered to evaluate further and revealed evidence of tamponade physiology. Moreover, the patient had a pulsus paradoxus of 16-18 mm Hg on exam. The interventional cardiology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] who performed pericardiocentesis which produced 470mL serosanguanous fluid which was consistent with exudate by lites criteria. Over the next day, the drain put out another 500cc of fluid. The fluid was sent for cultures which were all negative. Cytology on pericarial fluid was positive for malignant cells. After one day, the pericardial drain was pulled, and the tip sent for culture which was also negative, and the patient was transfered out of the CCU. After arrival to [**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained stable on NC, however clinically appeared still distressed. On [**2180-11-3**], a repeat ECHO was performed and it showed small pericardical effusion, reassuring us that the fluid had not reaccumulated. Per Cardiology recs, pt was instrusted to get another repeat ECHO on [**2180-11-22**] when she return for her outpt appt with oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] will follow-up on the ECHO results. . # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a mild metabolic acidosis and an anion gap of 15. The most immediate concern was for a lactic acidosis from her respiratory distress and impaired tissue oxygenation or a possible starvation ketosis. Repeat labs the morning after admission revealed a worsening of her acidosis with a HCO3 of 15 (down from 20 on admission). An ABG revealed an appropriate respiratory compensation with a pCO2 of 31. The metabolic acidosis soon resolved and pt remained stable. . # Breast cancer: CT on admission showed dramatic progression of metastatic disease involving the lungs bilaterally. She was continued on capecitabine 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **], and transfered to the oncology service. Once on [**Hospital1 2035**], given pt's breast cancer was progressing on current therapy (CA27-29 rising) and pt's clinical status was deteriorating, inpt attending and outpt oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] discussed started a new chemotherapy regimen. Thus, pt's capecitabine was stopped and on [**2180-11-3**] pt was given Herceptin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin. 20 minutes into the infusion, Herceptin was stopped bc pt developed SOB and hypoxia to mid 80s. Pt's symptoms resolved with time, Ativan and Lasix. Herceptin was attempted again on [**2180-11-6**]. This time the infusion was stopped 60 min into the infusion bc pt developed tachycardia. Pt's symptoms resolved with time. Pt was started on Neupogen 24 hours after chemotherapy administration to prevent neutropenia. The Neupogen was discontinued on day of discharge as pt's WBC was still >15. . # Elevated LFTs: Pt had midly elevated LFTs after chemo administration, which were trending down with time. . # Diarrhea: Pt developed diarrhea during the hospitalization. C diff was negative. Likely [**12-28**] chemo. Diarrhea improved with Imodium. . # Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was approximately 39, at the patient's known baseline. The patient subsequently received several liters of intravenous fluids for her tachycardia and her hematocrit came down to 35. Pt's Hct remained stable in the 31-35 range. Pt did not require any transfusions. . # Crohn's: Patient was continued on her Mesalamine without event. . # Pt was on regular diet. Pt was full code. Pt was on SC Heparin for DVT ppx.

She was well until about 12 hours prior to admission when she described the acute onset of sharp right lower quadrant pain and diffuse/poorly characterized dull general abdominal pain. The pain was described as sharp, constant. The pain radiated to the back. It got worse with motion, better with motrin. The pain was associated with nausea and bilious vomiting times 1, subsequent to the onset of pain. The patient also described subjective fevers and chills. The paitent did not have any constipation, diarrhea, change in the color of her stools, dysuria, hematuria, vaginal discharge, itching, or bleeding. No history of recetn truama, travel. she has not been sexually active since her delivery Past Medical History: recurrent respiratory infections allergies Gastroesophageal reflux disease removal of cystic mass of breast removal of labial cyst degenerating fibroid during pregnancy Social History: works in a research lab no tobacco, or alcohol travelled to [**Country 2045**] in [**2081**], bermuda in [**2088**] Family History: No history of bowel problems. Father had a history of hypertension Physical Exam: temperature 100.8, pulse 81, blood pressure 109/71, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 100% on room air General: patient was in moderate distress, appeared acutely ill Head and neck: head atraumatic/normocephalic. sclera anicteric. No lymphadenopathy, no jvd Card: regular rate and rhythm Lungs: clear to auscultation Abdomen: soft, mildly distended. Diffuse tenderness, RLQ>LLQ. Positive for rebound, especially in lower abdomen Back: no costovertebral angle tenderness. Pelvic exam: significantly limited secondary to discomfort, exquistite tenderness at the interoitus, unable to get in foot rests. Minimal thin white discharge, right adnexal and fundal tenderness consistent with peritonitis On discharge the patient had a well healing midline incision, as well as ostomy sites that were pink and healthy. Stool and gas were present in the ostomy bag. Her abdoment was soft and nondistended Pertinent Results: Blood cultures negative, CMV IgG positive, CMV IgM negative, CMV DNA negative, RPR negative, Fungal culture negative, Stool negative for (camplobacter, salmonella, shigella, vibrio, yersina, ecoli 0157:H7, Cdificile, virus), HSVI/II negative, Hep B SAb positive, Hep BSAg negative, Cervical cultures negative for GC and chlamidyia, Rheumatoid factor negative, HIT negative, Cystic fibrosis negative, sickle negative, lupus anticoagulant negative, cryoglobulin negative, [**Doctor First Name **] 1:40, ANCA negative, HCG negative. Cardiolipin antibiodies are pending. Pelvic Ultrasound [**2103-7-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Fibroid uterus. 2. Normal appearing ovaries bilaterally. No ovarian torsion seen at the time of the exam, although clinical correlation is needed to entirely exclude this diagnosis. 3. Mild-to-moderate amount of nonspecific free pelvic fluid. Abdominal CT [**2103-7-25**]: ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a trace right pleural effusion and slight atelectasis at the right lung base. The NG tube extends into the stomach, where it makes a loop in the fundus. There is a large amount of fluid in the peritoneum. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and ureters appear unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended without CT evidence of wall edema. The proximal small bowel is collapsed. The mid small bowel is distended with air-fluid levels. The distal small bowel is not distended. Rectal contrast opacifies the colon, reaching the cecum. There is severe thickening of the cecal wall. The appendix seems to be normal in caliber although surrounded by inflammatory changes and fluid . These findings are most consistent with cecitis, which could be infectious or inflammatory. Ischemic etiology is less likely. PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST: The uterus is enlarged with multiple fibroids, some of which demonstrate calcified rims. The bladder and rectum are unremarkable. There is a large amount of fluid tracking down from the abdomen. BONE WINDOWS: The visualized osseous structures appear unremarkable. CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in evaluating bowel anatomy. There is severe cecal wall thickening. The appendix is normal in caliber. IMPRESSION: 1) Inflammatory changes in the rigth lower quadrant most likely consistent with cecitis, which could be infectious or inflammatory. Ischemic etiology less likely. 2) Large amount of intraperitoneal fluid. 3) Dilated mid small bowel loops, likely secondary to ileus. 4) Fibroid uterus. Pathology: Appendix: Acute appendicitis with acute serositis. No evidence of vasculitis seen. Ileocecal resection specimen: 1. Ileum and proximal margin: Vascular congestion. 2. Colon: a. Severe vascular congestion, submucosal edema, and transmural acute hemorrhage. b. Areas of acute transmural ischemic infarction (slides C and D). c. Distal margin: No infarction. d. No convincing evidence of a primary vasculitis. Scattered small veins have mural acute inflammation and fibrin thrombi, but these changes are almost certainly secondary to the colonic wall injury. e. One lymph node: No diagnostic abnormalities recognized. Peritoneal fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Echocardiogram: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise. IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion. No 2D echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis identified.+ Brief Hospital Course: The patient was initially taken emergently to the operating room for exploratory laparascopy with general surgery back up. She was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics. They observed a normal left tube and [**Last Name (un) 2046**], and copius greenish yellow fluid, as well as right lower quadrant adhesions and a diffusely inflammed small intestine. The General surgery team became infvolved and noted that the appendix was acutely inflamed but there was no other pathology. after completion of the exploratory laparatomy, the patient remained tachycardic, with otherwise stable vital signs, but required >15 L of resucitation. Despite this the patients Hematocrit rose from 41.3 to 52, and her WBC rose form 12.9 to 39.7. The patients urine output also began to decrease. The patient was becoming edematous and the patient had increased respiratory distress. it was believed that the patient was third spacing, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for monitoring. On post op day 2, the patient was taken back for a reexploration given that the patient had the hemodynamics above, and the patients abdominal exam worsened. In the operating room they discovered a retroperitoneum that was diffulsely petichial and ecchymotic, with significant retroperitoneal edema and bowel edema. the appendages eppiplocae were hemorrhagic. There was pathc purpuring darkening concerning for ischemia of the cecum. The patient underwent a right colectomy, with an ileosotomy and right transverse colon mucous fistula. the patient could not be closed and the abdomen was left open. The patient was sent back to the intensive care unit, intubated. The infectious disease and rheumatology services were consulted and were intimately involved, and the results of the studies they suggested are listed above. The patients hemodynamic status improved, although the patient remained tachycardic and intermittently febrile, although cultures remained negative and the patient remained on broad spectrum antibiotics. She continued to recieve fluid boluses for decreased urine output on post operative days 3 and 1. TPN was started on post operative days 4 and 2. On post operative days 5 and 3, the patient had an echocardiogram to rule out an embolic source for possible mesenteric ischemia, and a HIT panel was sent for decreased platelets. On post operative days 6 and 4 the patient was brought back to the operating room for closure of her abdomen. A vent wean was started on post operative days 7,5,and 1 and continued until postoperative days 10/8/4 when she was successfully extubated. Her NG tube was also discontinued. She was transferred to the floor and on postoperative days 12/10/6 the patient was started on sips. She was seen by physical therapy, as well as continued on her TPN. Her TPN was discontinued on the following day, while the patient started taking clears. The patient was also seen by enterostomy therapy to help in teaching. She remained hemodynamically stable, was passing stool through her ostomy bag, had a well healing incision, and was tolerating a regular diet, and was ready for discharge on post operative day 14/12/8, with a 1 week course of cipro flagyl to be completed per the Infectious disease team.

She tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss and was transferred to the PACU and then the floor. While on the floor she began having fevers and tachycardia on POD 1. Blood cultures were sent with one bottle out of four returning positive for MRSA. She was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and fluid resucitation. She recovered three days later with respect to her tachycardia and was afebrile after 3 days of vancomycin. Back on the floor she was found to have an ileus with abdominal distension. We placed an NGT for decompression and kept her NPO. On POD 7 she was started on clears and was advanced to a regular diet over the next two days. We noted that her surgical wound was draining some serosanguinous fluid, so we opened up 3-4 staples and packed the wound with a wet to dry dressing. She was discharged with VNA for care of this wound as well as her ileostomy wounds on POD 10. Medications on Admission: none Discharge Medications: 1.

      "Admission Date: [**2189-2-18**] Discharge Date: [**2189-2-25**] Service: CCU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and history of a gastrointestinal bleed, who presented to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**] at 8 A.M. with epigastric pain. The patient's pain started at approximately 7:30 A.M. on the day of admission after eating breakfast. It was described as a burning sensation. The patient took one sublingual nitroglycerin without effect. The patient reportedly denied any shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or headache. The patient had been off her aspirin and Plavix secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed in [**2188-12-26**], requiring hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1196**]. Electrocardiogram obtained in the Emergency Department showed upsloping ST segments and was initially interpreted as J-point elevation. Subsequently at 1 P.M., the patient's systolic blood pressures decreased to the 40s and repeat electrocardiogram at that time revealed bigeminy with ST elevations of 5 mm in V2 through V4. Cardiology team was consulted, and the patient brought emergently to the catheterization laboratory with systolic blood pressures in the 80s. In the catheterization laboratory, the patient's blood pressure was marginal, with pressures between 70s and 80s systolic, and dopamine drip was started. Initial angiogram showed significant left anterior descending obstruction. Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed. The patient was then electively intubated, as oxygen saturations were decreasing on non-rebreather mask. Arterial blood gas as that time was a pH of 7.16, pCO2 of 51, and pO2 of 51. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease status post left anterior descending stent and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to diagonal I and obtuse marginal I on [**2188-11-28**] 2. Congestive heart failure 3. Hypertension 4. Chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia 5. History of a gastrointestinal bleed, recently discharged from the hospital on [**2189-2-10**] ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS AT HOME: Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily held since [**2-10**], Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily held since [**2-14**], Synthroid 25 mcg by mouth once daily, Zestril 5 mg by mouth once daily, Lopressor 50 mg by mouth twice a day, folate 1 mg by mouth once daily, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily, Timoptic one drop to each eye once daily, Xalatan one drop to each eye once daily, prednisone 30 mg by mouth once daily PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.8, blood pressure 88/42, heart rate 122, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100% on 50% FIO2. In general, the patient is an elderly white female, sedated and intubated. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs. Lungs: Bibasilar crackles. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel sounds. Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, right groin PA catheter and arterial line in place, left groin intra-aortic balloon pump in place. LABORATORY DATA: White blood cells 14.2, hematocrit 31.8, platelets 283. Differential: Neutrophils 97%, lymphs 3%. Sodium 142, potassium 3.4, chloride 106, bicarbonate 24, BUN 23, creatinine 0.8, glucose 101. INR 1.1, PTT 20.6, PT 12.7. CK at 10 A.M. on [**2-18**] of 46, at 2 P.M. 475, with an MB of 60 and an MB index of 12.6 and a troponin of 40.9. Urinalysis was benign. Chest x-ray showed heart size within normal limits, a prominent pulmonary vasculature was noted, bilateral interstitial opacities were noted. Electrocardiogram at 8:47 A.M. showed sinus at 87 beats per minute, left axis deviation with left ventricular hypertrophy, 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1, upsloping ST elevations in V2 and V3, no ST depressions or Qs. Electrocardiogram at 1:05 P.M. with decreased blood pressure showed bigeminy at 96 beats per minute, [**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in V2 and V3, 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V4 and V5, ST depressions in II, III and AVF, Q waves developed in V2 through V5, with loss of R wave progression. Cardiac catheterization from [**2189-2-18**], had the following findings: Left dominant system with three vessel coronary artery disease, the left main coronary artery was normal, the left anterior descending was totally occluded at the site of the previously-placed proximal stent, the ramus intermedius branch had a long tubular 80% stenosis, the left circumflex artery had a 50% proximal stenosis, the first obtuse marginal branch was totally occluded, and the second obtuse marginal branch had a 70% origin stenosis, the left posterior descending artery had a mild luminal irregularity, the right coronary artery was a small non-dominant vessel and had an 80% proximal stenosis. Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending in-stent lesion, and successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the ramus intermedius branch. Hemodynamic measurements performed after the coronary intervention with the patient intubated requiring intravenous inotropic support with intra-aortic balloon pump in the left femoral artery revealed elevated left-sided filling pressures. The wedge pressure was 21 mm Hg. The cardiac index was marginally decreased at 2.1. As above, an intra-aortic balloon pump was introduced into the left femoral artery. IMPRESSION: 82-year-old female with previous coronary artery disease status post recent left anterior descending stent, Class II congestive heart failure, hypertension, history of recent gastrointestinal bleed, presents with acute ST elevation, anteroseptal and anterior wall myocardial infarction. Taken to the catheterization laboratory for intervention and admitted to the Coronary Care Unit, intubated, with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place, as well as on a dopamine drip secondary to hypotension. HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: 1. Cardiac: a. Ischemia: As above, patient with proximal left anterior descending stent in-stent re-stenosis as well as significant occlusion to the ramus intermedius status post intervention. The patient was started on aspirin and Plavix post-intervention. Peak CK was noted to be 71 to 85, which was on [**2189-2-18**], which gradually trended down to a value of 113 on the day of admission. In addition, the patient was started on an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker once blood pressure could tolerate. b. Pump: As above, patient noted to be in cardiogenic shock with increased wedge and decreased systolic blood pressure. Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the catheterization laboratory. The patient was also given lasix x 1 in the catheterization laboratory for elevated wedge pressure, and diuresed well with this one-time dose. No additional lasix doses were given on hospital day number one, and greater attention was paid to improving hemodynamics with pressor and inotropic agents. The patient was initially transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on a dopamine drip, however, was noted to be markedly tachycardic to as high as 130s to 140s in sinus rhythm. The decision was made to discontinue the dopamine and start milrinone for inotropic effect and Levophed for pressor support. The patient's blood pressure was titrated to greater than 60, and the patient's heart rate subsequently was better controlled in the 80s to 90s. Subsequently, with improved hemodynamics, decision was made to remove the intra-aortic balloon pump on hospital day number three. In addition, on the following day, the patient's milrinone and Levophed drips were discontinued as the patient was maintaining adequate hemodynamics on her own. Lastly, a decision of whether the patient should be long-term anticoagulated in light of her recent anterior wall event was to be evaluated with an echocardiogram. Decision to anticoagulate long-term will be weighed against the possible risks in light of underlying gastrointestinal pathology and a history of a recent gastrointestinal bleed. c. Rhythm: Patient noted to have a sinus tachycardia on arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, on a dopamine drip. Subsequently was switched to milrinone and Levophed drips. The patient's sinus tachycardia improved to normal sinus rhythm with occasional episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which was thought secondary to reperfusion. 2. Pulmonary: Patient noted to be hypercarbia and hypoxic in the catheterization laboratory on a non-rebreather, and decision for intubation was made. The patient was maintained on assist control on arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, and subsequently was weaned with successful extubation on hospital day number three. 3. Hematology: Patient with a history of chronic anemia secondary to chronic autoimmune hemolytic etiology, maintained on prednisone as an outpatient. In light of recent events, the patient was placed on stress dose steroids through the intravenous, which was subsequently changed to oral prednisone. The patient received two to three units of packed red blood cells while in the Coronary Care Unit secondary to a slightly decreased hematocrit, which was thought secondary to her underlying chronic condition as well as possibly secondary to her gastrointestinal bleed in light of some coffee-ground emesis. The patient's hematocrit remained relatively stable during her hospital stay, with a range of 28 to 33. 4. Gastrointestinal: As above, patient with a history of a gastrointestinal bleed with one to two episodes of coffee-ground emesis while in the Coronary Care Unit. Coffee grounds then cleared, and the patient was maintained on Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice a day. As above, the patient's hematocrit remained stable for the most part during her hospital stay, and she remained hemodynamically stable, and there was no need for Gastroenterology consult during this hospital stay. 5. Renal: The patient's creatinine status post cardiac catheterization remained at her baseline, and there were no acute renal issues while an inpatient at [**Hospital1 346**]. 6. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: Patient's electrolytes were monitored closely, with adequate repletion, especially in light of some ventricular ectopy noted on telemetry. Initially nothing by mouth secondary to intubation, and the patient was started on low-dose tube feeds at 10 cc/hour, ProMod with fiber. Upon extubation, tube feeds were discontinued, and the patient was advanced to an oral diet without complications. This has been a dictation detailing the hospital events from [**2189-2-18**], to [**2189-2-22**]. Addendum to follow detailing the rest of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, including a list of discharge diagnoses, discharge medications, and plan for discharge and follow up.

      "Admission Date: [**2189-2-18**] Discharge Date: [**2189-2-26**] Service: CCU Please note that this interval dictation takes up on [**2189-2-23**], where the dictation of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**] [**Name (STitle) **] previously dictated left off. ADDITIONAL HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was transferred from the Coronary Care Unit to the floor at approximately 3 A.M. on [**2-23**], without event. At approximately 9 A.M., the patient began to complain of shortness of breath and was found to be tachycardic to the 150s after walking a distance to the bathroom. The patient's electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST elevations in Leads V2 and V3, otherwise the electrocardiogram was unchanged. On examination, the patient had a blood pressure of 146/60, pulse of 135, pulse oxygenation 98% on 2 liters, was diffusely wheezy on respiratory examination, and was markedly diaphoretic, without jugular venous distention or edema. The patient was given several doses of intravenous Lopressor, as well as high-dose intravenous lasix. The pulse oxygenation transiently fell to 88% on 5 liters face mask, and an arterial blood gas taken was 7.37/32/56. A chest x-ray demonstrated increased congestive heart failure and the patient was given some nitro paste without effect, and then begun on nitroglycerin drip as well as additional lasix 80 mg intravenous push. The patient rapidly thereafter clinically improved, with a blood pressure falling from a high in the 170s/80s to 135/76, with a normalization of respiratory rate and a pulse oxygenation of 92 to 95% on 6 liters, as well as over a liter of urine out ultimately, and a clearing of previous wheezing on examination. The patient was again cycled with cardiac enzymes, which revealed a troponin elevated greater than the measurable range, likely from the prior cardiac events that were described in Dr.[**Name (NI) 2056**] dictation. However, repeated measurements of creatine kinase failed to demonstrate an elevation in that enzyme, and rather demonstrated a continued trend down. The patient was begun on standing lasix initially at 40 mg once daily, which was then increased to 40 mg twice a day, and then to 80 mg by mouth twice a day. The thought being that the patient had been approximately 4 liters positive during this admission, and that the above-described events likely represented worsening congestive heart failure/pulmonary edema in the setting of volume overload. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure was better controlled with Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day, and the patient's Lopressor dose as well was increased to 50 mg by mouth three times a day with good effect on the patient's cardiac rate. The patient's hematocrit continued to be stable for the remainder of this admission. She had no further respiratory difficulties, and was seen by Physical Therapy, who suggested inpatient therapy to improve the patient's endurance. The patient was sent for echocardiography, which demonstrated an ejection fraction between 20 and 25%, with multiple wall motion abnormalities as described. In discussion with the Cardiology team, the decision was made not to anticoagulate the patient at this time, given her recent history of significant clinical gastrointestinal bleeding. In consultation with the patient's attending cardiologist, decision was made to discharge the patient to rehabilitation on [**2189-2-25**]. Please note that during the sequence described for [**2-23**], the patient's electrocardiogram appeared to show sinus tachycardia with the above-stated ST elevations in V2 and V3, which did resolve with the patient's tachycardia. ADDITIONAL DATA: The patient was sent for echocardiography on [**2-24**], with the following findings: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with extensive regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation. The left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be between 20 and 25%. Left ventricular wall motion was noted in detailed report to have abnormalities in the basal anterior portion, which was hypokinetic, mild mid-anterior which was akinetic, basilar and anteroseptal which was akinetic, mid-anteroseptal which was akinetic, basal inferoseptal which was hypokinetic, mid-inferoseptal which was hypokinetic, anterior apex which was akinetic, septal apex which was akinetic, inferior apex which was akinetic, lateral apex which was akinetic, and apex which was dyskinetic. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Lasix 80 mg by mouth twice a day, Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day, Ambien 5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime as needed, Prevacid 30 mg by mouth twice a day, Timoptic 5% one drop to both eyes once daily, Xalatan one drop to both eyes once daily, NPH four units subcutaneously twice a day, regular insulin sliding scale, folate 1 mg by mouth once daily, Synthroid 25 mcg by mouth once daily, Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily for 25 days (to complete a one month course), Lopressor 50 mg by mouth three times a day and hold for systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 100 or pulse less than or equal to 60), aspirin 81 mg by mouth once daily, levofloxacin 250 mg by mouth once daily for five days (to complete a ten day course), prednisone 50 mg by mouth once daily for four days then prednisone 40 mg by mouth once daily for four days then prednisone 30 mg by mouth once daily (this is the patient's baseline prednisone dose for her autoimmune hemolytic anemia). DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Status post myocardial infarction 2. Congestive heart failure 3. Hypertension 4. Chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia 5. Gastrointestinal bleeding DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient will be discharged to rehabilitation. She is to follow up with her primary care physician and cardiologist within one week of discharge from rehabilitation, as well as with her primary hematologist/oncologist or other physician for follow up of chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The patient will be continued on finger stick blood glucoses four times a day with regular insulin sliding scale as described. It is suggested that the patient's electrolytes be measured every other day and repleted as necessary. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable.

      "Admission Date: [**2189-3-17**] Discharge Date: [**2189-3-25**] Service: CCU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease with recent CCU stay and autoimmune hemolytic anemia who presented again to the CCU after being admitted to the floor with a two-day history of weakness, increased shortness of breath, decreased She had stent to the left anterior descending at an outside hospital in [**2188-11-25**]. She then represented to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2189-2-18**], with her anginal equivalent (epigastric pain) and was found to have ST elevations on her electrocardiogram in leads V2-V5. She had a complicated emergent catheterization. The catheterization placed on Dopamine and intubated. On catheterization, the patient had in stent restenosis of the left anterior descending, and she received percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A lesion of the ramus intermedius was stented as well. Intra-aortic balloon pump was initiated at that time. She had a four-day stay in the CCU when she was able to be taken off the balloon pump and ventilatory support. She did have an episode of acute hypoxia after transfer to the floor that improved with diuresis and nitrates. She was discharged two weeks to this current admission to a nursing home. On presentation to the Emergency Department the patient had a heart rate of around 100, and systolic blood pressure in the 80-90s. Hematocrit was down to 24.5. Hematocrit on discharge from her prior hospitalization was 33; however, her baseline hematocrit is in the mid 20s. She was transfused 1 U of packed red blood cells in the Emergency Department. She had no electrocardiogram changes on arrival to the Emergency Department. Upon arrival to the floor, she had acute decrease in oxygen saturations to the low 80s with tachypnea and tachycardia to the 150s. She was given intravenous Nitroglycerin drip, intravenous Lasix, and intravenous Lopressor 2.5 mg, as well as IV Morphine 2 mg. Her ABG showed a pH of 7.19, and a pCO2 of 48, and a pO2 of 56. The patient was intubated and transferred to the CCU. Her electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with unchanged segment elevations in V2-V4 compared with baseline. Her chest x-ray was consistent with increasing congestive heart failure compared with earlier in the day. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2189-1-23**]. Catheterization in [**2188-11-25**] with stent to the proximal to the left anterior descending, and PTCA to the ramus and diagonal, 80% proximal right coronary artery lesion. Catheterization in [**2189-1-23**] showed 100% proximal left anterior descending in stent stenosis, and PTCA was performed, as well as 100% OM1 lesion, as well as an 80% ramus lesion which was stented. Catheterization was complicated by hypotension and respiratory distress as described in the HPI. 2. Systolic dysfunction a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20-25% by echocardiogram earlier this month showing mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy as well. Echocardiogram also showed near akinesis of the entire septum and anterior wall of the left ventricle, as well as distal inferior and distal lateral wall akinesis. The apex was aneurysmal as well. 3. Hypertension. 4. History of GI bleed. The patient had an admission during [**2189-1-23**] for GI bleed. 5. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia followed by Hematology/Oncology at [**Hospital6 1760**] diagnosed in [**2188-11-25**]. 6. Diabetes mellitus thought to be steroid induced. 7. Hypothyroidism. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d., Ambien 5 mg q.h.s., Prevacid 30 mg b.i.d., Timoptic 0.5% eye drops, Xalatan eyedrops, NPH Insulin 4 U b.i.d., sliding scale Insulin regular, Synthroid 0.25 mg q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d., Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d., Aspirin 81 mg q.d., Prednisone taper currently at 30 mg q.d. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient resides at [**Hospital 582**] Nursing Home. Denies tobacco. Occasional alcohol. She is a retired hair dresser. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: On admission temperature was 100.0??????, heart rate 100, blood pressure 118/51, oxygen saturation 100% on 60% FIO2 on vent setting AC 12 x 550 FIO2 60% .............. to 7.5. General: The patient was intubated, awake, responsive. The patient was in no acute distress. Cardiovascular: Regular, rate and rhythm. No murmurs. Audible over breath sounds. Respirations: Diffuse anterior crackles. Extremities: Trace bilateral lower extremity edema. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds. Soft, nontender, nondistended. Guaiac negative in the Emergency Department. Neck: There was 9 cm JVP. LABORATORY DATA: White count 12.4, hematocrit 29.4 up from 24.5 in the Emergency Department, platelet count 290; INR 1.1, PTT 23.4; potassium 3.4, BUN 28, creatinine 1.4, glucose 172, magnesium 1.7, albumin 3.1; CKs serially 41, 36, 39, troponin 1.3 on the morning of admission. ASSESSMENT: This was an 83-year-old woman with known congestive heart failure and ischemic coronary disease presenting flash pulmonary edema in the setting of blood transfusion. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Cardiovascular/ischemia: The patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization while intubated. The catheterization showed instant restenosis of her left anterior descending stent at 40%; however, distal to the stent, there was an 80% focal lesion which was ballooned and stented. Her ramus stent were patent with associated ostial 40% lesion. Her known 80% right coronary artery lesion remained unchanged. Right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary wedge pressure of 30, RA pressure of 12, PA pressure of 61/34, RV pressure of 61/16. Cardiac output was 4.4 with an index of 2.9. Mixed venous saturation in the Catheterization Lab was 57.6 from the pulmonary artery. The patient did well postcatheterization and was able to be extubated. She was placed on Aspirin and Plavix for life. Beta-blocker was re-added, and Lopressor was titrated up 50 mg b.i.d. Ace inhibitor was also added. Her statin was continued as well. She remained chest-pain free and free of shortness of breath throughout the rest of her hospitalization. 2. Cardiovascular/pump: The patient's ejection fraction was known to be 20%. Heart catheterization confirmed her fluid overload and congestive heart failure physiology. She did not respond to Lasix on initially arriving in the CCU; however after catheterization, she diuresed well to Lasix with general improvement in her PA diastolics and improvement of her kidney function. She was able to be extubated without difficulty after adequate diuresis was achieved. Upon arrival to the floor from the CCU, the CHF Service was consulted. They recommended initiating Digoxin, low-dose nitrate, and standing p.o. Lasix which was done. She was discharged with plans to follow-up with the CHF Service for continued medical management of her congestive heart failure. 3. Pulmonary: The patient was able to be initially extubated on the second hospital day; however, on the day after initial extubation, her status remained tenuous with increasing Nitroglycerin drip and p.r.n. Morphine required to reduce her preload enough to maintain oxygenation. On the night after initial extubation, she required emergent reintubation due to acute hypoxia. Chest x-ray prior to intubation demonstrated white-out of the lower two-thirds of the right lung; however, film 3-4 hours postintubation showed resolution of the opacity throughout the right lung consistent with acute mucous plugging. It was therefore thought that that episode of hypoxia was not due to congestive heart failure but to mucous plugging. The patient was reextubated without difficulty status post catheterization and maintained satisfactory oxygenation throughout the remainder of her hospital stay. She was also started on Levofloxacin on admission due to suspicion of right upper lobe infiltrate. Levofloxacin was switched to Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin on the third hospital day. She remained afebrile throughout her hospital course but did however start to develop a cough toward the end of her hospital stay. She was continued on the Ceftriaxone through the hospital stay with the plan for a total 14-day course along with her Azithromycin. 4. Infectious disease: As above, the patient was treated for suspicion of pneumonia. Of note, she had an isolated positive blood culture growing gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters from [**2189-3-19**]; however, she was afebrile throughout the time surrounding this culture. Repeat cultures were drawn on [**2189-3-24**], and were pending at the time of this dictation. 5. Heme: The patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia with a baseline hematocrit in the mid 20s. As noted in the HPI, she was transfused 1 U prior to her episode of flash pulmonary edema. Hematology Service was [**Name (NI) 653**], and they felt that it would be acceptable to transfuse the patient as needed. The patient was transfused with one additional unit of blood during her hospital stay. Due to her steroids and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, she was restarted on stress dose steroids as she had been on her previous admission. These were quickly tapered to a discharge dose of Prednisone 10 mg q.d. The patient had stable blood pressure and hematocrit on this dose. 6. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition: The patient developed hypernatremia toward the end of her hospital stay with a peak sodium of 151. It was thought that this was due to inadequate p.o. intake and free-water intake, and she was encouraged to maintain p.o. intake. A Nutrition consult was obtained as well. Follow-up labs of her sodium were pending at the time of this dictation. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to acute rehabilitation in stable condition. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., Timoptic 0.5% eye drops 1 drop per eye q.d., Xalatan 0.005% solution 1 drop to each eye q.d., Folate 1 mg p.o. q.d., NPH Insulin 4 U subcue b.i.d., Synthroid 250 mcg p.o. q.d., Azithromycin 250 mg p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Prednisone 10 mg q.d., Ceftriaxone 1 g IV q.24 hours to be discontinued on [**4-1**], Lopressor 50 mg p.o. q.d., Onalopril b.i.d., Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d., Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary artery disease status post new stent to the left anterior descending. 2. Congestive heart failure complicated by flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation. 3. Pneumonia. 4. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

CAD/ACS. OSH reported ECG with ST depressions in V2-V5/Elevation in III and negative CE??????s. Admitted with ACS and sent directly to cath. TNTs drawn post cath and positive, but trended down ([**12-20**] PCI?). CK??????s were flat. Thus, was unclear where to place pt on spectrum of UA --> STEMI. Card Cath revealed: R dom. 3VD. LMCA widely patent. LAD 50% at ostium. LCX 70% mid lesion (before OM1. RCA long 70% lesion (before bifurcation off the PDA and posterolateral branch). RCA Drug-Eluting Stent was placed and it was deemed the patient should be evaluated for CABG at a future date. Of note, after cath, the patient was extremely sleepy and had RR of 8. He was sent to the ICU for monitoring, but was lucid and stable within 8-10 hrs. His sleepiness was attributed to the large amount of sedatives, opioids that he received at the OSH and intracath. He was not given Narcan. He was stable and CP free for the remainder of his admission. Continuous telemetry monitoring revealed SR (50s-70s).

He presented today to the emergency room after [**Hospital 2081**] clinic noted severe bilateral papilledema; opthomology suggested this was secondary to either elevated intracranial pressure in the setting of malignant hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri. He has been symptomatic with blurry vision over the past month in the absence of headaches or other central symptoms. He has noted some gait instability. In the ED, his blood pressure was noted to be 180/118. He took his usual dose of one of his blood pressure meds (unknown) and his BP improved to 160 systolic. He was transferred to the MICU for management of hypertensive emergency. Past Medical History: Hypertension, hypertensive chronic kidney disease stage IV, systolic heart failure, last ejection fraction from [**Hospital 2082**] between 25 and 30%, obesity, and tobacco abuse.

No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Bilateral proptosis. renal u/s [**2159-4-9**]: Both kidneys show increased echogenicity consistent with chronic kidney disease. Two simple cysts in the right kidney, one at the upper pole and one at the lower pole. Doppler evaluation of both renal arteries and of the arcuate/segmental vessels in the renal parenchyma was within normal limits. No ultrasound/Doppler evidence for renal artery stenosis. tte [**2159-4-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Brief Hospital Course: #Hypertensive Emergency: Pt presented with HTN systolics >200 and blurry vision, found to have papilledema. The patient's blood pressure was markedly elevated with systolic blood pressures ranging from 160-210 during ICU stay. Review of prior notes outlines a longstanding history of poorly controlled blood pressures. His home isosorbide and carvedilol were discontinued. Labetalol was uptitrated to 200mg TID, Hydral downtitrated to 50mg TID, clonidine 0.3mg weekly patch started, and furosemide/metolazone continued as is. MAP >120 was goal. On leaving the ICU SPB was in 130s. TSH was within normal limits. It was felt that this patient needed a full workup for secondary causes of hypertension. In the meantime renal artery ultrasound done here showed no renal artery stenosis but did show chornic bilateral changes consistent with CKDD. He should likely have a workup for hyperaldosteronism (see hypokalemia below) and workup including urine metanephrines and dexamethasone suppression test, as he is quite young for this degree of hypertension and seems to be compliant with his medications. He was initially started on spironolactone given report of EF 25-30% and thought that it may help with hypokalemia, however after 3 days (3 doses) this was discontinued so that pt could ideally have a renin/aldosterone level drawn prior to discharge (which is now pending), several days after discontinuation. Would recommend restarting this medication after the appropriate studies have been done. It is more than likely this patient has sleep apnea as well; in the ICU he was noted to have desats during sleep with very loud snoring. Desats resolved instantly on waking. Pt is also smoking and quite obese both of which are likely worsening his hypertension. Would recommend outpatient sleep study as well. . #hypokalemia - pt was noted to be hypokalemic with potassium 2.9-3.2. Concern for hyperaldosterone state given concommittant resistant hypertension. Pt required >160meq potassium repletion per day while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and still remained with K below 4.0. Outpatient records demonstrate history of low potassium. Pt also had been started on spironolactone, and while it was low dose, it did not appear to help with potassium retention. This was also unusual in the setting of elevated creatinine/chronic renal failure, which emphasized concerns for hyperaldosterone state. Spironolactone was DCd temporarily so that he could have renin/[**Male First Name (un) 2083**] levels drawn. #Intracranial hypertension: Likely secondary to systmemic hypertension. Neurology evalauted patient in ED and suggested potential LP if BP controlled to assess for pseudotumor cerebrii, though this can be deferred to outpatient setting if papilledema does not improve with improved BP control. . #Chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine was elevated at 3.6-3.7, which is baseline. CKD likely secondary to hypertensive nephropathy. Continued sevalamer and nephrocaps. . #Chronic systolic CHF: No echo in the system, but OSH records per Dr.[**Name (NI) 2084**] note states TTE showed increased wall thickness, estimated LVEF 25-30% and global hypokinesis without focal wall motion abnormality, as well as increased [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**], with estimated PA systolic pressure 32mm. The patient appeared euvolemic on exam, without evidence of an acute sCHF exacerbation. His blood pressure control was adjusted as above, including the addition of spironolactone to his regimen. Despite his renal impairment, he may benefit from the addition of an ACEi/[**Last Name (un) **] and should discuss this with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], and nephrologist. He was continued on a beta blocker (though switched from metoprolol/carvedilol to labetalol), lasix, and metolazone. His EF on the TTE here showed an EF of 55%. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Has PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2086**], and nephrology follow-up scheduled -Needs outpatient sleep study -Would benefit from work-up for secondary hypertension if not already done at another facility - follow up renin/[**Male First Name (un) 2083**] ratio, may draw urine metaneprhines, dex suppression testing -Patient was a Full Code during this admission -Would benefit from nutrition consult - Has Cr and K ordered as outpt on Thursday which needs f/up Medications on Admission: B COMPLEX-VITAMIN C-FOLIC ACID [NEPHROCAPS] - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - Dosage uncertain CARVEDILOL - 25 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day FUROSEMIDE - 20 mg Tablet - 3 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day HYDRALAZINE - 100 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth three times a day ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE - 120 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth Qday METOLAZONE - 5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth Qday METOPROLOL TARTRATE - 100 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day POTASSIUM CHLORIDE - 20 mEq Tablet, ER Particles/Crystals - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth Once a day SEVELAMER HCL - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - Dosage uncertain Discharge Medications: 1. furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day). 2. hydralazine 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day).

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 2087**], You were admitted to the intensive care unit at [**Hospital1 771**] with very high blood pressures and blurry vision. Your blurry vision was likely caused by your high blood pressure. When your blood pressure is this high, you are at risk for serious complications including further kidney damage and possible stroke. We monitored you closely and changed some of your blood pressure medications to help better control your blood pressures. We made the following changes to your medications: STOPPED: -Carvedilol -Metoprolol -Isosorbide mononitrate DECREASED: -Hydralazine from 100 mg three times a day to 50 mg three times a day INCREASED: -Potassium chloride 20 meq chrystals increased from one dose once a day to two doses once a day STARTED: -Clonidine patch 0.3 mg once a week -Labetalol 400 mg three times a day -Lisinopril 2.5mg once a day We did not make any other changes to your medications. Please continue to take them as you have been doing. It is very important that you take your blood pressure medications and monitor your blood pressure. If your blood pressure is persistently higher than 190/110, you should contact your doctor. Also, if you develop any worsening blurry vision, headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or weakness on one side of the face or body, you should seek medical attention immediately. We are concerned you may have a condition called obstructive sleep apnea, and we recommend you have a sleep study after you leave the hospital. We also recommend that you see a nutritionist and work on continuing to lose weight. Please eat a low salt diet. We also strongly encourage you to stop smoking. Please also note that you will need to get your creatinine and potassium checked on Thursday, [**2159-4-12**].

She then called one of her friends afterwards, and her therapist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2110**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) was subsequently involved and called the EMS for patient. In the ED, her initial VS were HR 99, BP 102/56, RR 20, and 98% on RA. She arrived with her friend, very lethargic. Per report, was only responsive to sternal rub and GCS of 8 throughout. Tox screen showed positive benzos and acetaminophen only. ECG showed sinus tachycardia. UA was negative. CT head did not show ICH. Her initial Tylenol level was 40. Toxicology was consulted and recommended NAC for 21 hours until level is undetectable and LFT stabilizes. She started NAC in the ED and her repeat level was 29. VS prior to transfer were T95, HR 66, BP 121/73, RR 22, O2Sat 98% RA. She was transferred to the ICU for her poor mental status.

      "Admission Date: [**2182-1-19**] Discharge Date: [**2155-2-24**] Service: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease now with bradycardia. He had an episode of dizziness when walking today. His wife took his pulse and noticed it was \"slow.\" The patient reportedly had some relief from his symptoms after his wife gave him a sublingual nitroglycerin. He subsequently had a second episode of dizziness at rest and went to the Emergency Department. There, he was found to have a pulse of 30 without P waves. External pacing was attempted and unsuccessful capturing. Atropine was given without effect. He was started on dopamine 10 mcg per minute and noted to revert to sinus at 50 beats per minute then hypertension to the 200s. The patient was reportedly still complaining of dizziness while in sinus. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and palpitations. He had an exercise treadmill test on [**2181-1-5**] which was stopped for shortness of breath with no ST segment changes. Rhythm was sinus with rare isolated AEA and VEA with blood pressure responsive flat. Nuclear images with moderate defects, apex with ejection fraction of 65% and mild apical hypokinesis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Coronary artery disease; in [**2179-5-27**] with 20% left main coronary artery, a DV left anterior descending with noncritical stenosis and widely patent stent in the proximal segment. First obtuse marginal with critical lesion. Left circumflex with mild luminal irregularities and 40% proximal right coronary artery. Mild diastolic function with ejection fraction of 60% with a normal wall motion. 2. Hepatitis C virus. 3. Hypertension. 4. Nocturia. 5. Osteoarthritis. 6. Ventral hernia. 7. Cholelithiasis; status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. 8. Colon cancer; status post colectomy in [**2165**]. 9. Positive purified protein derivative. 10. Cervical degenerative joint disease. ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Atorvastatin p.o. q.d. 4. Doxazosin p.o. q.h.s. 5. Zoloxafed 200 p.m. 6. Tolterodine 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. 7. Losartan 80 mg p.o. q.d. 8. Diphenhydramine 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. 9. Glucosamine 500 mg p.o. q.d. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION: On physical examination, his pulse was 35, blood pressure was 100/42, respiratory rate was 22. He was 91% on room air. In general, he was lying with the head of the bed at 20 degrees, in no acute distress. His pupils were equally round and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular motions were intact. Oral mucous membranes were dry. Jugular venous distention was difficult to assess secondary to constant head and oral movement. He was bradycardic with a normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly. His abdomen with a prominent ventral hernia was soft, nontender, and nondistended. Normal active bowel sounds. His extremities showed 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally with no pitting edema. PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION: White blood cell count was 7.8, hematocrit was 42.6, and platelets were 180. Prothrombin time was 12.9, partial thromboplastin time was 24.2, INR was 1.1. Sodium was 145, potassium was 5.1, chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was 22, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 115. CK was 63. Troponin was less than 0.3. Calcium was 9.9, magnesium was 1.9, phosphate was 5.2. RADIOLOGY/IMAGING: Electrocardiogram showed junctional bradycardia at 36 beats per minute with left axis with waves in III and aVF and inverted T waves in III with no ST segment changes. Electrocardiogram after dopamine showed a normal sinus rhythm at 61 beats per minute, a left axis, high-normal P-R interval, Q waves in III and aVF, T wave flattening in III, and no ST segment changes. HOSPITAL COURSE: He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit as a percutaneous wire was unable to capture and v-pace. His heart rate was maintained on dopamine. His rhythm was found to be an atrial exit block, likely the cause of his dizziness. He was evaluated by Electrophysiology and was sent for pacemaker placement. On the second night of admission he was complaining of insomnia and was given Ambien and became very agitated. At that time, he pulled out his right internal jugular Cordis. Two hours after replaced, he received 2 mg of intravenous haloperidol for the confusion and seemed to calm down. It was thought to be secondary to the Ambien which was discontinued. He had no further episodes of hallucinations or agitation at that time. His creatinine improved with hydration to his baseline of around 0.8. He was maintained on his outpatient medications for BPH and osteoarthritis. He received a pacemaker on [**2182-1-21**] without complications. His hematocrit remained stable. He had received three doses of vancomycin perioperatively. His beta blocker and angiotensin receptor blocker were resumed as they had previously been held while on dopamine and also with his tendency for bradycardia. These were resumed without issue. The only complicating factor was he was slightly nauseated with vomiting after returning from his procedure. It was thought this was likely due to the sedation. He was given antiemetics, and it resolved the following day when the sedation wore off. He was able to eat and ambulate without dizziness or concern. Therefore, he was discharged home in good condition. MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. 2. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. 3. Atorvastatin p.o. q.d. 4. Doxazosin p.o. q.h.s. 5.

He also developed some pleuritic chest pain several days ago. The chest pain was located in the left side of the chest below the nipple line and occurred with deep inspiration. The pt reports these are all similar to previous episodes of COPD exacerbation. The pt had tried nebulizers Q4hours in addition to 2L NC one day PTA without any improvement. The pt uses oxygen at home 40% of the time, mostly when he is active. The pt noted inc. DOE even with the oxygen prior to this episode.

Admitted w likely COPD exacerbation triggered by viral URI. Nasal complaints and absence of infiltrate go against a bacterial PNA. MI and PE also considered. Pt treated with nebulizers, steroids, azithromycin. ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis which appears compensated. Pt oxygenated well on O2 by nasal canula, but developed respiratory distress w accessory muscle use, tachypnea and tachycardia, which required MICU transfer on [**2-17**] for increasing respiratory distress. He was subsequently intubated that same night as his respiratory status continued to worsen. He remained stable on the vent and was extubated without complications on [**2-19**]. His respiratory status continued to be stable post-extubation. He was continued on azithromycin for a three day course and continued on steroids. He was then transferred back to the medical floor the following day after extubation with stable respiratory status. Followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2171**]. On the floor his steroid regimen was kept as IV until patient's SBO resolved. With resolution of SBO patient was transitioned to PO steroids. Pt was discharged with a steroid taper. His last dose of Prednisone 10mg [**3-6**]. . On the floor his dyspnea continued and he required 4-5 L of nasal O2. He was evaluated by palliative care after he made the decision to become DNR/DNI. Based on their recommendations he was switched from ATC morphine to MS contin and ativan for dyspnea related anxiety. He was noted to have mental status changes including confusion, somnolence so MS contin was discontinued with return to normal mentation. His respiratory continued to improve with decrease in anxiety noted. Patient's pain was well controlled with liquid morphine, fentanyl patch, and tylenol #3 as needed. . # HIV/AIDS: Patient on HAART with recent decrease in CD4 count to below 200, hence on bactrim ppx. Followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**]. HAART was temporarily discontinued in the setting of SBO with nausea and vomiting. With resolution of SBO, HAART was restarted on [**2152-2-29**]. . #Small bowel obstruction: Patient developed acutely worsening abdominal pain on the [**Hospital1 **] associated with nausea and vomiting. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a partial SBO. He was made NPO and a nasogastric tube was placed. Patient's nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention improved steadily. His NGT was clamped and eventually discontinued on [**2-28**] with advancement of his diet to a regular diet. He tolerated that well. . #Pneumonia: Patient was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia incidentally on chest xray evaluating PICC placement. Labs at the time were remarkable for leukocytosis. He was started on Zosyn and vancomycin for presumed Hospital associated pneumonia. Patient's vancomycin was stopped on [**2-27**]. He was continued on Zosyn and then transitioned to PO levoquin on [**2-29**] and discharged on this medication to complete an 8 day course of antibiotics with last day of antibiotics to be [**2152-3-4**]. . # Hypertension: Normotensive on admission, mild elevation in blood pressures in the setting of respiratory distress. Patient was continued on his home dose of doxazosin while in house. . # GERD: Stable. Continued H2 blocker. . # Anemia: Hematocrit dropped slightly during hospital admission from patient's baseline of 36 to 22. Iron studies demonstrated most likely anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia coupled with dilutional effect of IV hydration and daily blood draws as reasonable explanation of drop in hematocrit. Patient was always hemodynamically stable with no signs or symptoms of active bleeding. Patient was started on PO Iron.

The patient had been recently admitted 5/13-16/[**2153**] for COPD exacerbation and treated with nebs, azithromycin, prednisone (slow taper). The patient presented to the ED on [**2154-4-2**] for dyspnea but left AMA before admission. He was sent to the ED on [**2154-4-8**] but left AMA again, with prednisone and azithromycin prescriptions which he never filled. He had seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in pulmonary clinic yesterday and had been non-compliant with prednisone taper. He endorsed \"exhaustion\" at the appointment but was stable 93% on 3.5L nasal cannula. The patient had also been at [**Hospital **] Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2185**] prior to Pulmonary appointment. . The patient re-presented to the ED today with worsening dyspnea and was brought in by EMS in respiratory distress (enroute CO2 50). He responded to nebulizers enroute and arrived looking very uncomfortable, using accessory muscles. He was tight on pulmonary exam with minimal breath sounds and speaking few word sentences. The patient was started on BiPap (50%, PSV 15, PEEP 5), which he tolerated well. He was briefly weaned off to 4L NC but decompensated, tripoding despite Methylprednisolone 125mg IV X1, Azithromycin 500mg, more nebulizers and ativan 2mg IV. .

CXR [**4-9**]: Patchy opacity in left lung base, similar to the prior study, which remains concerning for infection. Severe emphysema. . CXR [**4-13**]: An endotracheal tube lies at the level of the clavicular heads, appropriately positioned. A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach. Severe emphysema is noted. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The left lower lobe opacity has mildly improved and reflects resolving infection. No new focal consolidation is appreciated. . Discharge Labs: None Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old male with history of HIV (CD4 116 [**2154-4-8**]), COPD (2-4L at home), DVT on coumadin, hypertension, chronic lower back [**Last Name (un) 2187**], osteoporosis who presents with respiratory distress. . # Respiratory Distress: Most likely due to ongoing COPD exacerbation. Trigger unclear given lack of pneumonia on initial CXR, no fevers/chills, productive cough. Patient has been non-compliant with medications, however, since discharge; this includes prednisone and antibiotics. ?compliance with nebulizers and has supplemental O2 at home. The patient has had CTA recently to rule out pulmonary emboli given ongoing dyspnea despite therapy. He was treated with azithromycin for 5 days and methylprednisolone. He intermittently required BiPap. A plan was made to use bipap at night once the patient was able to leave the ICU. However on the morning of [**4-13**] patient was anxious, tachypneic and desatted and required intubation. The patient was extubated on [**4-14**]. He did well overnight but subsequently had further respiratory distress and his steroids were increased to full burst. He ultimately decided to be DNR/DNI and came to the understanding that he wasn't going to get better; the patient decided to become CMO and was discharged to home hospice after discussing with Palliative Care in-house. - Continue long steroid taper at home (Prednisone 60mg X 7 days, 40mg X 7 days, 20 mg X7 days, 10mg X 7 days, off) - Continue supplemental oxygen, albuterol and ipratropium nebs - Continue MS contin and morphine liquid PRN for air hunger, shortness of breath - Continue lorazepam PRN for air hunger, shortness of breath, anxiety . # HIV: Down trending CD4 count, ?due to acute illness. Continued abacavir, lamivudine, fosamprenavir, and atazanavir. Continued Bactrim SS daily. Patient does have history of Bactrim needing to be held in [**10/2153**] for bone marrow suppression. The need for ongoing HAART medication and PCP prophylaxis was discussed with the patient. It was felt that he likely will not succumb to HIV/AIDS or an opportunistic infection before he succumbs to his end-stage COPD. However, taking these medications are not a hardship for the patient and he would prefer not to risk increasing HIV viral load and chance of opportunistic infection, especially in the setting of ongoing steroids. - The patient will be discharged home on hospice with continuation of his HAART medications and Bactrim PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. . # DVT: LENI the day prior to admission as outpatient was negative for DVT. Patient has been therapeutic and followed by [**Hospital3 **] here at [**Company 191**]. He missed several doses of Coumadin in the settting of being on Bipap and developed a subtherapeutic INR. He was bridged with Lovenox. Anticoagulation held [**4-13**] for concern for GIB but coumadin was resumed when hct was stable for 24 hrs. Upon discharge home with hospice, however, anticoagulation was discussed with the patient. As he had a DVT in [**2152-3-17**] and ultimately completed treatment but was continued given his sedentary/immobile nature, the indication for ongoing anticoagulation and risk of DVT/PE is not high. - Given this information, the patient chose to be discharged off of coumadin. His primary care provider and the [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] anticoagulation nurses were informed of his decision, and the fact that he no longer needs INR checks. . #GIB: Patient noted to have guaic positive stool. T+S sent, PPI started, PICC placed, transfused 1 unit of blood but did not bump appropriately, so given 2nd unit. Hct then increased appropriately and remained stable. - PPI was stopped given the absence of frank melena on discharge and to minimize medications for hospice. . # Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Seen in the ED during patient's hospitalization [**2154-3-28**]. Patient was started on diltiazem in this setting but did not have MAT last admission either. The patient can continue on home diltiazem on discharge to prevent discomfort from breakthrough tachycardia. . # Anemia: Slightly lower than baseline Hct close to 30. Normocytic and previously thought due to chronic disease. HAART medications may be contributing to marrow suppression. In addition, pt noted to have guaic positive stools which are discussed above. . # Hypertension: Stable, mildly hypertensive, continued [**Last Name (un) **] diltiazem and doxazosin. -- doxazosin was stopped on discharge for hospice to streamline medications. . # Osteoporosis: On Calcium and Vitamin D. - These medications were stopped on discharge to streamline medications. . # GERD: Admitted on famotidine. Stable, started on PPI as above while intubated as famotidine can also interact with HIV medications; also in setting of guaiac positive stools per above. - Famotidine was stopped on discharge to streamline medications. . # Other transitional issues: - Continue home O2 as prescribed - Oral suction as prescribed - Maintain PICC with appropriate heparin flushes as a provision for morphine infusion if patient's air hunger is refractory to PO morphine elixir and he requires IV morphine Medications on Admission: * Atazanavir 400mg daily * Fosamprenavir 1400mg twice daily * Aspirin 325mg daily * Abacavir 600mg daily * Lamivudine 300mg daily * Albuterol nebs every 2 hours PRN SOB, wheezing * Ipratropium nebs every 6 hours * Warfarin 3mg daily six times weekly, 2mg on Friday * Doxazosin 2mg qHS * Diltiazem 30mg three times daily * Famotidine 20mg daily * Bactrim 400-80 daily Discharge Medications: 1. atazanavir 200 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Capsule PO DAILY (Daily). 2. diltiazem HCl 30 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day). 3. sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 400-80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). 4. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: Ten (10) mL PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation. 5. lamivudine 150 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). 6. abacavir 300 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). 7. fosamprenavir 700 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q12H (every 12 hours). 8. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every four (4) hours: Standing.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair. Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with difficulty breathing. You were found to be having a COPD exacerbation. You were treated with steroids (oral and intravenous), antibiotics, nebulizers. You were also put on a breathing machine called BiPap to make it easier for you to breath. With your very sick lungs, you did become very tired at one point, and were intubated to use a machine to help you breath. Once you were extubated, we discussed your prognosis and the severity of your condition with you. You made the decision to change your code status to Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate. The goals of your medical care was made for comfort. . You are being discharged home with hospice, who will oversee your care going forward and address all of your symptoms with the goal of making you comfortable. . It is important that you continue to take your medications as directed. We made the following changes to your medications during this admission: --> Stop Coumadin and INR checks --> Stop Aspirin --> Stop Doxazosin --> Stop Famotidine --> Continue prednisone 60mg daily X 1 weeks, with a slow taper --> Start Lorazepam as needed for shortness of breath, air hunger, anxiety --> Start MS Contin 30mg three times daily for air hunger --> Start Morphine liquid 5-10mL every 2 hours as needed for air hunger --> Start Prednisone and take as directed according to the prescribed taper --> Continue Albuterol nebs every 4 hours standing --> Continue Albuterol nebs every 2 hours as needed for shortness of breath, wheeze --> Continue Ipratropium nebs every 6 hours standing .

New opacification at the periphery of the left lung is due at least in part to breast prosthesis. There could be a new small left pleural effusion or even consolidation. Followup advised. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. No right pleural effusion. Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 2190**] was admitted under the acute care surgery service on [**2148-2-3**] for further evaluation and management of her injuries. She was initially admitted to the trauma ICU for close monitoring given her rib fractures, and was transferred to the floor on HD#1 as she remained stable. Neuro: She remained alert and oriented throughout her hospitalization. Her pain level was routinely assessed. She was initially administered IV narcotics for pain control, and was transitioned to an oral regimen when tolerating PO's. Prior to discharge, she reported adequate pain control on an oral regimen. CV: Her vital signs were monitored routinely and she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Serial hct's were checked given her liver lac, initially q6h on admission and then [**Hospital1 **]. They remained stable, and she remained without evidence of blood loss. Pulm: Given the small size of her pneumothorax, no chest tube placement was necessary. Agressive pulmonary toileting and incentive spirometry were encouraged. Nebulizer treatments were administered. Her supplemental oxygen was able to be weaned. Prior to discharge, her oxygen saturation was within normal limits on room air. She remained without respiratory compromise. GI: She was initially kept NPO with IV fluids for hydration and an NG tube was placed on admission given her liver laceration. Her hematocrit remained stable and abdominal exam remained benign, so the NG tube was removed on [**2-4**] and she was started on clear liquids. Her diet was slowly advanced over the next 24 hours and she was tolerating a regular diet at discharge. She was started on a bowel regimen given her narcotic intake. GU: A foley catheter was placed on admission. Her intake and output were closely monitored. On [**2-5**] it was removed and she voided without difficulty. Musk: Orthopedics was consulted given her pelvic fractures and lumbar transverse process fractures. These injuries were determined to be stable requiring no surgical intervention. Follow up in the orthopedic clinic was scheduled for 2 weeks from discharge. Physical therapy was consulted to evaluate her mobility, given her injuries determined she was best suited going to rehab. The patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition, pain controlled on oral medication, tolerating a regular diet, and urinating without difficulty.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane). Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after being struck by a motor vehicle. As a result of this accident you sustained multiple injuries as listed below. Your multiple rib fractures can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain. * You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician. * Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that pool in the lungs. * You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing. * Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short periods may ease the pain. * Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible. * Do NOT smoke * If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side effects so make sure your doctor approves. * Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus ).

Radiology: CXR [**11-16**]: Diffusely increased opacities at the lung fields bilaterally. In an immunocompromised patient, this is concerning for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Radiographically, the differential includes pulmonary edema. Additionally, there is a faint opacity at the right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or focal pneumonic process. . CT-Head [**11-16**]: Focus of low attenuation within the subcortical white matter of the right medial frontal lobe. This may represent a subacute infarction; however, an underlying mass lesion cannot be completely excluded. An MRI examination with gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for further evaluation. No intracranial hemorrhage noted. . MR-head-w&w/o gadolinium [**11-18**]: Signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. This finding most likely represent a small infarct. However, in absence of ADC map, age of the infarct could not be determined. No abnormal enhancement is seen. Follow up is suggested, if clinically indicated. . Echo [**11-18**]: 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. While difficult to assess given the limited views suspect Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 7.There is no pericardial effusion. . If clinically indicated, would recommend a TEE. . CXR [**11-21**]: Resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis . Studies: EEG [**11-17**]: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing - all consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. No evidence for ongoing seizures is seen. Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for UC (prednisone, 6MP) who presents with new onset HA, fever with bacterial meningitis and gram positive rod bacteremia. . #. Listeriosis - meningitis and bacteremia. Patient presented with headache, nuchal rigidity, expressive aphasia, afebrile on admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED, where she also started to have rigors. LP showed >300 WBC, poly predominant with 5% monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16. CSF gram stain showed gram positive rods, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation eventually grew listeria. Empiric treatment based on gram stain was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and question of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending confirmation of gram stain and culture results. Once speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd. Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**11-21**], when it was changed to prophylaxis dose. Early on admission, she developed hypotension that required levophed, but was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of admission with PRBCs (total of 4 units) and volume resussitation. Given bacteremia, TTE was done, no vegetations or lesions noted. Head CT on admission showed right medial frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, no hemorrhage. Subsequent MRI confirmed infarct, unclear date, and EEG consistent with meningitis. Neurology was consulted, and the patient was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis given meningoencephalitis. She spiked fevers to 101-102 over the first several days of admission. By [**11-19**], her neurological exam was markedly improved, and by [**11-21**] her headache was gone, no meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essential tremor was slightly more severe. Surveillance blood cultures reamined negative from [**11-17**] on. Notably, she was transferred from ICU to floor on [**11-21**], but noninvasive BP was read as 60/d, patient mentating well, sent back to ICU. In the ICU, an arterial line was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmHg higher than sphyngomanometer. This discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but persistent. Patient maintained normal mentation, good urine output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points. On [**11-23**], she was sent to the floor for further care and management. . #. Bilateral lung opacities/hypoxia. Initial chest film read as increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP (given steroids and no PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5**]) vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema. She had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her respiratory distress led to her being placed on CPAP+PS. The origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be secondary to likely vascular leak from sepsis/CHF versus PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**] induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of PCP was small. She responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced O2 requirements. . #. UC: She continued to receive her outpatient dose of prednisone, which was changed on [**11-22**] to dexamethasone IV; her outpatient 6-MP was held. After several days with no diarrhea, it recurred on [**11-22**] soon after her diet had advanced. C.diff was negative. She was made NPO, and fed via TPN for bowel rest. On [**11-24**], it was noted that she began passing BRBRP, her hematocrit was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and consent for blood transfusion. . #. Anemia. On admission, she was found to be anemic. She received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again [**11-19**] for mixed venous sat <70%. She was found to have iron binding studies c/w anemia of chronic disease. Her HCT was followed closely, and remained stable for the remainder of her admission. . #. FEN: Her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made NPO with TPN on [**11-22**] after she developed diarrhea, thought secondary to continued UC activity. . #. Prophylaxis: PPI. Hold SQ Hep, pneumoboots. Initially on droplet precautions. . #. Code status: FULL . #. Communication: patient, her sister, brother, and mother . #. Lines: peripheral IV x 2. left subclavian CC. A-line. Eval for PICC; once in place, can d/c central line, a-line. Surgery Discharge part: Pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on [**2147-11-26**]. She was on Clinda/Gent peri-procedure and Amplicillin for 21 days at first. She was seen by PT/OT and was NPO until the ostomy started to function. SHe had c/o nausea as diet was tolerated and it was slowed down. MRI was suspicious for an abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6 weeks as per ID. She was given a PICC. On [**12-5**] she was cleared by PT and was in good condition for d/c to rehab on [**2147-12-5**].

Two possible sources of infection existed including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered while gardening. She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased ostomy output. When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was discontinued. Blood cultures were sent and a U/A was not concerning for infection. We also sent off galactomannan antigen and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic fever workup which were negative. The following day after admission her WBC rose significantly and she no longer was neutropenic. As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and he CXR became concerning for an infiltrate. She was continued on Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than 48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia. . # Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding to IVF boluses. She refused central line placement in the ED and peripheral pressors were initiated. This is most likely related to her underlying infectious process. She was not administered any medications recently that could be accounting for her hypotension. Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures are sbp of 90s-100s. An a-line was obtained which showed higher BP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. She was given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off pressors the night of admission to the ICU. Her cuff and a-line pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line was discontinued. . # Breast Cancer- currently in cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) + Cyclophosphomide. Most likely this current episode of neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was also a possibility. . # Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at home doses. . # Nausea- Continued compazine and PO zofran prn.

Discharge Instructions: Dear [**Known firstname 17**], It was a pleasure to take care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted for low white cell (neutrophil count), fever, and pneumonia. You required monitoring with blood pressure supporting medications and IV antibiotics in the intensive care unit. Fortunately, your counts improved and you responded nicely to the antibiotics. Please continue to take levofloxacin to treat your pneumonia for a total of 8 days (last dose on [**2154-5-7**]). As we discussed if you notice fever, worsening breathing problems, or any other concerning symptoms to return to the emergency room immediately. We have made the following changes to your medications: START levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for 4 more days ([**2154-5-7**]) You should discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] the possibility of restarting neulasta with your next chemotherapy cycle.

Rigid bronchoscopy, debridement, T-tube placement. 2. Baclofen Pump Removal. 3. RUQ Hematoma Evacuation. 4. Percutaneous Gastrostomy Tube. 5. Left Antecubital PICC Line. History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS [**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her nursing home. According to notes from [**Hospital6 33**], the pt was found at her nursing home yesterday ([**3-26**]) AM, shaking her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed seizure). She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 34**] ED. . In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR 12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin, Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed. Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys, glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+ cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**3-9**] bottles. Micro lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**]. CXR showed cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed questionable changes from prior that might suggest the possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management. Past Medical History: PMH: 1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for spasticity 2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis 3.

TTE on admission: 1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen. . CT abd post-op: 1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**3-28**], [**2171**]. 2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further characterization. 3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones. 4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases. . EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized slowing followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were independent bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe encephalopathy. A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of the encephalopathy. . EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage II sleep with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of intermittent and independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both sides. This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In addition, exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the underlying infection. . MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild communicating hydrocephalus. . MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow signal. . MRA [**4-4**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No evidence of vascular occlusion seen. . TEE: 1.The left atrium is normal in size. 2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. 6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. . Head CT [**4-7**]: Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci. Brief Hospital Course: 1. GBS meningitis/bactermia In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on Gentamicin (for synergy). Her intrathecal baclofen pump was thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying pump in RUQ). Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the operation appeared to be without complication. The following day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be hypotensive with an SBP of 70. After spiking a temp, it was thought that she might be septic. She was given fluids, PRBCs, FFP, and placed on Levophed. Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site. Pt was taken emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. She returned to the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. Given 1 additional unit of PRBCs. Her hct bumped appropriately and remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. Pt developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought to be [**1-8**] to PCN allergy. Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone. Repeat LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). CSF analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. Prior to leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. She was pancultured and all cultures were negative. A TTE ruled out endocarditis in the setting of group B strep bacteremia. On day #12 of gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of her treatment course. . 2. RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to be bleeding into the RUQ pocket. She was taken to the OR for emergent evacuation of the hematoma. On POD #16, pt was noted to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ. Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but found a new fluid collection. Surgery was consulted and they diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given that it had no signs of infection. . 3. Pneumonia: Towards the end of the pt's ICU stay, she was evaluated by speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the passy-muir valve. She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent for culture. The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram negative rods (not pseudomonas). She was started on vancomycin for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR. Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas, ceftaz was stopped. Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that were persistently high. Vancomycin troughs should be checked often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15. After the pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was assumed that the pt aspirated. That day she also spiked a temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage. Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-20**] (14-day course) and Flagyl's course will be complete on [**4-24**] (after 10 days). . 4. Supraglottic edema As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she failed a passy-muir valve. On bronchoscopy it was noted that she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized. She was taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed. ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to evaluate her anatomy. The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway. Ideally, she will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the patient has recovered from her acute illnesses. . 5. Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease. Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained stable. . 6. Multiple sclerosis Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. She was without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr HR, temp, BP, seizures) once pump was removed. She continued on Baclofen 20mg qid po with an Ativan taper. PO baclofen was then tapered to 20mg tid. . 7. Mental status At baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she is alert, oriented, and conversant. Her decreased responsiveness was thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished reponsiveness persisted. Repeat LP in the unit suggested a resolving meningitis. Neurology was following the pt and recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule out subclinical seizures. An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures. An MRI was finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke. Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and eventually returned to her baseline mental status. Pt's mental status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology as an outpatient. . 8. Respiratory status After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (At baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis but does not require mechical ventilation. Trach in place to help with clearance of secretions.) Pt placed on A/C in unit, then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask with good results. At time of discharge, she was satting well on 40% trach mask. . 9. HTN In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s. Pt has hx of hypertension. Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen d/c. BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. . 10. Sacral decub ulcer: Stage 1-2. Wound care nurse followed while pt was in-house. . 11. FEN: During pt's acute illness, she had an NGT placed. Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids and pureed food. The following day, she was noted to have soup coming out of her trach so she was again made NPO. Pt then passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration after trying some ground solids. She was made NPO and GI placed a PEG for feeding. Pt should remain on tube feeds until her tracheal swelling is much improved. At that point, another swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po feeding. . 12.

Toes downgoing bilaterally Coordination: pt too lethargic to perform Pertinent Results: CT head: Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. Recommend head CTA to evaluate for an intracranial aneurysm. Findings were discussed with Dr. CTA: FINDINGS: There is a 3 mm x 3 mm saccular outpouching from the region of the anterior communicating artery (2:317), consistent with aneurysm. This has a very narrow neck, and would be amenable to endovascular intervention. No other aneurysm or vascular abnormality is seen. There is stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery. Otherwise, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent, with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion. The distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm on the right, and 5 mm on the left. Mild-to-moderate multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes are noted. IMPRESSION: 3 mm saccular aneurysm arising from the anterior communicating artery, with narrow neck. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 83**] was admited on [**2175-3-12**] and became increasingly lethargic and transferred to the ICU for further care under the Neurosurgery service. A diagnostic CTA revealed a large ACOM aneursym which was coiled the following day. Post Coiling the pt. was admitted to the ICU with a ventricular drain. There were no incidences of increased intracranial pressure or decline. A cerebral perfusion study performed [**3-15**] confirmed the lack of vasospasm and develoing strokes. He had some R shoulder weakness and shoulder X-ray was concerning for rotator cuff injury and orthopedics was consulted. On [**2179-3-16**]/14/15 his ventricular drain was clamped and reopened due to elevated ICP levels. On [**3-19**] he was transferred to the SDU and continued to remain stable. He had his ventricular drain clamped on [**3-21**] and after 48 hours of the clamping trial he had a CT done which was stable without any evidence of hydrocephalus. At this time the drain was pulled. He was placed on a fluid restriction for a brief period of time for a drop in his Na level, and also on salt tabs, upon discharge to rehab we have removed the fluid restriction, but we are continuing the salt tabs, we advise that the Na level be checked every other day, and the salt tabs may be d/c'ed when Na is stable on serial checks. Upon discharge his Na is 138. He is now ready for discharge to rehab. On discharge his exam is as follows: Alert and Oriented X2 Moving all extremities with full strength slight Right Drift, which has been persistant throughout his hospitalization, and possibly secondary to a rotator cuff injury.

hypernatremia and acute mental status changes and right sided paralysis. Her corrected sodium on admission was about 170s and her free water deficit was 5.5L. She was volume repleted with normal saline. She also recieved D51/4 NS for free water repletion initially and this was changed to free water boluses through nasogastric tube. Her sodium gradually trended down with free water repletion. She also was in pre-renal renal failure and her creatinine trended down with hydration. With regards to the acute mental changes, this is partially explained by the hypernatrmic state. However, she was also noted by the nursing home to have right sided weakness. CT head was performed on admission which was negative for stoke. Neurology was consulted and found that she has a MCA territory stroke by exam. A repeat CT head was performed on [**1-28**] which showed watershed infarct. TTE which was also obtained did not reveal any thrombus.Per neurology recommendation, all her hypertensive medication has been discontinued and she was started on aspirin. Chest XRay on admission was concerning for right lower lobe pneumonia. Her sputum culture grew MSSA for which she was on oxacillin. Levofloxacin was also started for community acquired pneumonia. Nasal aspirate was sent for influenza and was negative. She was intubated on [**2199-1-24**] for increased respiratory effort. Her resporatory decompensation was likely from aspiration pneumonia. She was extubated on [**2199-1-31**] when her lungs mechanic improved. However, given her depressed mental status and stroke, she was not able to clear her secretions well. SHe was intubated again on [**2-2**] after unsuccessful attempt to maintain her oxygen saturation with high flow mask. She recieved tracheostomy and G tube and tolerated well post procedure. Her nutrition status was maintained by tubefeeds and insulin sliding scale and NPH kept her glucose within range. Her blood pressure was initially low on admission. This responded well to hydration and brief use of levophed. Her [**Last Name (un) 104**] stimulation test was responsive. Admission EKG showed ST depression in V2-V3 and it was unsure if this is old. She had slightly elevated troponin, likely from acute renal failure which eventually trending down. Plastic surgery was consulted for decubitus ulcer. No debridement was indicated and their recommendation was to maxmize nutrition, wet to dry dressing and tight glucose control. She remained on sc heparin, lansoprazole, pneumoboots and bowel regimen as part of her porphylaxis. She had picc line placed upon discharge THere had been multiple discussion with her daughter, which is her health care proxy regarding code status. It was felt by the medical team that her condition will not likely improve despite optimal medical treatment. However, due to religious reasons, her family remained steadfast that everything should be done. However, her family agrees that should she go into cardiac arrest, there should be no chest compression or defibrillation.

EKG on admission-Sinus tachycardia with left bundle-branch block with secondary ST-T wave abnormalities. No diagnostic change from tracing #1. . [**Month/Day/Year **] on admission - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small, primarily anterior (?loculated) pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise with a prominent anterior fat pad. . [**6-6**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch block. Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2174-6-4**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise, no major change. . CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen. . Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery. Brief Hospital Course: # PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **] with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor urine output. - Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan. Were held initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her admission. - Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial of lasix proved successful. She will now go home on 160 mg PO daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], her nephrologist. She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition consult during stay. . # CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p recent LCx stent. She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix, and Losartan. . #. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty [**2174-5-11**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family: per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr. [**Name (NI) 137**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve replacment due to \"calcifications.\" Patient may be candidate for new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last [**Name (NI) 113**]. Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge. . # Respiratory distress resolved - Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started [**5-29**], continued for 7 days. She will continue lasix as outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema. . # ANEMIA/GIB: HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**5-31**] and this demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since. Her Hcts were between 26 and 28. Stools were checked for guiac, and were positive two days prior to dicharge. We discharged her home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss. She is not actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts. We also recommend an outpatient colonoscopy. Although, she needs to be very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema. . # Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr): Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been initiated on HD in [**2174-3-15**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to admission. Volume overload/CHF on admission, improved with UF, now appears euvolemic. Creatinine 1.... on discharge. Pt has history of RCC with nephrectomy. Renal function has seemed to normalize. Will continue follow up with nephrologist and he will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter. # Pt was discharge to home with services for PT and home health care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

Renal Failure Secondary Diagnoses: 1. Aortic Stenosis 2. Anemia 3. HTN Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, pt walking with a walker, eating on her own, with a normal mental status. Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure. You were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with diuretics. We also are continuing to give you the medicines carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure. You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off your lungs. In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission. Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**]. You also have a dialysis catheter in your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an outpatient. We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool. You should meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy. Make sure to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the bowel preparation they plan for you. Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs. Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet. Call the nutritionist with any questions. Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or fainting or any other worrisome symptoms, do not hesitate to call your doctor or call 911 in case of emergency.

      "Admission Date: [**2188-11-1**] Discharge Date: [**2188-11-8**] Service: Medicine [**Hospital1 139**] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female who has a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension, dementia, recurrent pneumonia and recent gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease, who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of increasing shortness of breath. The patient had been at home for approximately 2 days following discharge from rehab following gastrectomy when shortness of breath developed. Emergency medical services were called and the patient was found to have an oxygen saturation of 65% on room air and 85% on 100% non-re-breather. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypothyroid. 2. Coronary artery disease. 3. Hypertension. 4. Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy for perforated ulcer. 5. Dementia. 6. Esophageal motility disorder. 7. Recurrent pneumonia. SOCIAL HISTORY: Living situation - the patient at baseline resides at home with 24 hour home health assistance. There is extensive family involvement. The patient's code status is DNR, DNI. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. ALLERGIES: Sulfa. MEDICATIONS: 1. Aricept 10 mg. 2. Lasix 40 mg. 3. Prevacid 30 mg. 4. Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. 5. Multi-vitamin. 6. Effexor 70 mg. 7. Prednisone 25 mg. 8. Zofran p.r.n. 9. Synthroid 15 mg. EXAM: On presentation to the emergency department the patient was found to have vital signs as follows: Temperature 98.7, heart rate 82, blood pressure 160/62, respiratory rate 25, oxygen saturation 87% on room air. In general, the patient is a well nourished but thin female in respiratory distress. There was no jugular venous distention on examination of the neck. Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable. The PEG site was clean, dry and intact. The patient was alert and oriented only to person. LABORATORY STUDIES: Admission CBC was unremarkable. Admission SMA-7 was significant for an elevated BUN to creatinine ratio consistent with dehydration. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Cardiac enzymes were significant for an isolated elevated troponin. Coagulation studies were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas on 100% oxygen was significant for a decreased pO2 of 70 and an elevated pCO2 of 59 with a normal pH. RADIOLOGY: Chest x-ray on admission revealed mild congestive heart failure, markedly improved since the prior study of [**2188-8-17**]. There was also bilateral lower lobe opacification concerning for pneumonia. CT angiogram revealed consolidations at both lung bases consistent with bibasilar pneumonia as well as subtle patchy opacifications in the upper lobes with air fluid levels in the esophagus suggesting possible aspiration. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. CARDIAC STUDIES: EKG on admission revealed sinus rhythm with mild left axis deviation. There was also felt to be possible left anterior fascicular block. The admitting MICU team noted possible ST elevations in V3 through V6. Echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal left ventricular cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal. There was normal right ventricular systolic function. There was also moderate aortic regurgitation. No pericardial effusion. HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Respiratory distress: On admission, the patient was felt to have bilateral pneumonia, most likely secondary to aspiration. The patient was started on IV Levaquin, Flagyl and Vancomycin to cover for likely aspiration in a setting of recent nursing home admission. The patient was kept on supplemental oxygen to keep oxygen saturations above 92% and was kept NPO on aspirations precautions. On day of admission antibiotics were changed to IV ceftazidine, Flagyl and Vancomycin. Vancomycin was dosed at 1 gram q24 hours in the setting of patient's decreased renal function, age and body size. On day two of admission the patient was also felt to be fluid over loaded and gentle diuresis was resumed. On day two of admission the patient was felt to be stable for transfer to the floor. On the floor, the patient was initially continued on IV antibiotics. On day five of admission the patient had a follow up chest x-ray which revealed marked improvement in bibasilar pneumonia. The patient also had improvement in oxygen saturation and was able to tolerate room air. As a result, the patient was transitioned to p.o. antibiotics and was given Augmentin and Flagyl through the PEG tube. The patient was discharged home on hospital day 9 with instructions to complete a 14 day course of p.o. antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia. 2. Cardiovascular: Elevated troponin as well as possible ST elevations on admission were felt to reflect a demand ischemia. Cardiac enzymes and EKG changes stabilized. The patient was continued on aspirin, Lopressor throughout the admission. On day three of admission the patient had an episode of sinus tachycardia likely secondary to dehydration versus multi-focal atrial tachycardia secondary to pulmonary disease. This resolved following hydration. The patient's cardiovascular function remained stable for the rest of the admission. 3. Dementia: The patient was continued on Aricept throughout the admission. 4. Gastrointestinal: Following rehydration, the patient was found to have a mildly decreased hematocrit. As a result, the patient was received an elevation by gastroenterology to look for gastrointestinal bleeding as an etiology of decreased hematocrit. Given the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease, gastroenterology service recommended H. pylori serology, which was negative. Iron studies were sent, which revealed a decreased total iron binding capacity as well as decreased iron suggestive of a combination of both blood loss and chronic disease as etiologies of anemia. Gastroenterology service felt, however, that EGD and colonoscopy were not an option in setting of patient's recent ischemic cardiac disease. Furthermore, the patient refused gastroenterology work up. Gastroenterology service also asked to evaluate patient for possible contribution of reflux of jejunostomy tube feedings to development of aspiration pneumonia. Gastroenterology service felt that reflux of J-tube feedings was unlikely, however, felt that patient's long history of esophageal dysmotility could be contributing to aspiration. They recommended swallowing study. The patient received an oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation on day five of admission. This revealed mild oral with moderate to severe pharyngoesophageal dysphagia with significant impaired upper esophageal sphincter opening leading to severe residue of solids in the pharynx. However, there was no aspiration. Nevertheless, swallowing service recommended the patient in future have only thin liquids, pureed solids or very finely/minced meat in p.o. diet. They also recommended that the patient sit bolt upright at meals and for 45 minutes after meals. They recommended the patient remain at 45 degrees in bed at all times and should never lay flat in bed and recommended that if patient must remain flat in bed that tube feedings be discontinued for 30 minutes prior to patient laying flat in bed. 5. Endocrine: The patient was continued on Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. 6. GU: The patient was placed on Foley catheter on admission to the hospital. On day seven of admission the patient was ready for discharge from a medical standpoint, but did not void in time status post discontinuation of the Foley catheter. As a result the patient remained in-house for an additional day to ensure the patient could void spontaneously following discontinuation of Foley catheter. POST DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Metronidazole 500 mg q8 hours x7 days, Augmentin 500/125 mg p.o. b.i.d. x7 days, furosemide 40 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Venlafaxine HCL 75 mg capsule p.o. q.d., Levothyroxine 150 mcg p.o. q.d., donepezile hydrochloride 10 mg p.o. q.h.s., Lansoprazole 30 mg q.d., iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.d., multi-vitamin. DISPOSITION: To home with visiting nurse as well as 24 hour home health assistance. DISCHARGE STATUS: On day of discharge, the patient was ambulating, voiding spontaneously and had oxygen saturation of 97% on two liters. The patient was demented in a manner consistent with baseline. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Aspiration pneumonia. 2. Coronary artery disease. 3. Hypertension. 4. Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy. 5. Hypothyroidism. 6. Dementia. 7.

Two weeks prior to admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea. Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly unremarkable. On [**2175-9-17**], after coming home from his son's wedding, the patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe. His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the field and taken to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital where a chest x-ray was reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which was new. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] and Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation and management. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post right pneumonectomy, chemotherapy and radiation. 2. Transient ischemic attack. 3. Pulmonary embolism. 4. Atrial fibrillation, on Amiodarone. 5. Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy. 6. Diabetes mellitus. 7. Negative exercise Thallium test in [**2175-2-26**]. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2. Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. 3. Oxazepam p.r.n. 4. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. 5. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. 6. Neurontin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. 7. Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient has a sister who died of cancer at the age of 39, and an older brother status post coronary artery bypass graft. His father also had coronary artery disease and a sister has cardiac valve disease. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking three months ago following three to four packs per day times forty years. He consumed two to three drinks per day. He is a construction worker. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On admission, temperature is 99, heart rate 70 to 80s, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95%. In general, the patient was intubated and sedated. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination indicated the pupils 2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally. Endotracheal tube is in place. Cardiovascular - tachycardia with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Pulmonary examination - The patient had diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds on the right. The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normal bowel sounds. The extremities were warm with 1+ distal pulses. LABORATORY DATA: Initial laboratory studies at the outside hospital indicated that he had a white blood cell count of 11.4, hematocrit 41.0, platelets 466,000. The differential on the white blood cell count was 74% polys, 15% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes. Chem7 indicated a sodium of 136, potassium 5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 12, creatinine 1.3, glucose 285. Prothrombin time was 22.4, partial thromboplastin time 37.4, INR 3.0. Arterial blood gases indicated a pH of 7.29, paCO2 of 54, paO2 of 506 on a 100% FIO2. Urinalysis was within normal limits. CKs were 41 and 57 with a troponin of 0.04 and then 0.6. Chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat CKs. A Transesophageal echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and apical hypokinesis. The patient was also noted to develop new onset rapid atrial fibrillation with associated hypotension and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm but remained hypotensive requiring pressors. A CT angiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative. On [**2175-9-19**], a PA catheter was inserted which indicated decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock. The patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101 while urine culture grew E. coli. The patient was started on intravenous Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Tobramycin and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received intravenous fluids and was changed from Levophed to vasopressin with good effect. On [**2175-9-21**], the pressors were weaned. Bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture sites with some thick secretions. On [**2175-9-22**], the patient was successfully extubated. Over the weekend of [**2175-9-23**], and [**2175-9-24**], the patient defervesced with decreasing white blood count and was successfully switched to oral medications with stable blood pressure. His antibiotics other than Levaquin were discontinued. The patient was then transferred to the C-Medicine service for workup of coronary artery disease. Cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. The patient was titrated up on a beta blocker ace inhibitor. Lipid panel indicated a total cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 137, LDL of 133 and HDL of 41. He was therefore started on statin therapy for hypercholesterolemia. The patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the 30.0s during his stay in the C-Medicine service and was found to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, TIBC of 228, transferrin of 175. These findings were consistent with anemia of chronic disease and thought secondary to his lung cancer. On the C-Medicine service, the patient was noted to have bilateral carotid bruits. Carotid Doppler studies were performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis and mild plaquing bilaterally. The patient was maintained on Heparin during his hospital course and started on Coumadin two days prior to anticipated discharge with plan to discharge to home on Lovenox until the patient reached a therapeutic INR of 2.0 to 3.0. From an endocrine perspective, the patient was treated with regular insulin sliding scale for his diabetes mellitus with a plan to transition back to his home regimen of Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d. Fingerstick blood sugar indicated good glycemic control during hospital course. A physical therapy consultation was arranged and at the time of discharge dictation, it was anticipated that the patient would be deemed safe for discharge to home with outpatient physical therapy follow-up. At the time of dictation, the patient was planned to be discharged to home with VNA. He was also to follow-up in [**Hospital 191**] Clinic for an INR check on the day following discharge and was to follow-up with his primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] firm. He was to complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin, which had been switched to p.o. on the day prior to his discharge in order to treat his urinary tract infection. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urosepsis. 2. Acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior descending and left circumflex. 3.

      "Admission Date: [**2176-7-30**] Discharge Date: [**2176-8-4**] Date of Birth: [**2114-2-8**] Sex: M Service: [**Hospital1 212**] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62 year-old male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently admitted from [**7-15**] to [**2176-7-19**] for presumed bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough, shortness of breath and fevers. During his last admission two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day Prednisone taper and Augmentin for one week. He underwent bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial lesion, which was normal. Sputum sample was done at that time showed no growth. He was discharged at his baseline function on [**2176-7-19**]. The plan was to treat him for one week of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for one week, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks for pneumonia prophylaxis. The last dose of Augmentin was [**2176-7-22**] after being on Augmentin for only three days. He was doing well until approximately one week ago when he developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was due to low potassium. Within the following days he complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum. He had a low grade temperature, mild headache and worsening cough and presented to the Emergency Department. He denied any sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria or joint pain. In the Emergency Department he was febrile to 102 orally and had a heart rate of 160 and a blood pressure of 118/56. Respiratory rate 28. Sating 88 to 98% on 100% nonrebreather. Initially he was stable, but then had a gradual change in mental status with hypoxia, which resulted in his elective intubation. He received Lasix 100 mg intravenous twice, 1 mg of Bumex and 1 gram of Ceftriaxone as well as 125 mg of Solu-Medrol. He was also placed on a heparin drip for a subtherapeutic INR and given morphine and Ativan for sedation. Chest x-ray showed no focal pneumonia or evidence of heart failure. The patient then underwent a CT angiogram of the chest that showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Stage three squamous cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2175-2-26**], status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**] treated with neoadjuvant radiation therapy and carboplatin and Taxol. 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. Congestive heart failure, last echocardiogram [**2176-6-18**] with limited views showing grossly preserved left ventricular function and right ventricular function. 4. Atrial fibrillation in the postoperative period. 5. History of prostate cancer diagnosed in [**2172-2-26**], status post radical proctectomy with penile prosthesis in [**2172-8-27**]. 6. Diabetes mellitus type 2. 7. History of urosepsis. 8. History of pulmonary embolus postoperative in [**2175-6-28**]. 9. Myocardial infarction with a troponin of 4.1 in [**2175-6-28**].

Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 13. Sleep apnea. 14. Colonic polyps discovered in [**2173-5-27**]. 15. Hypercholesterolemia. 16. Small pericardial effusion in [**2176-5-27**], which subsequently resolved. ALLERGIES: Doxepin causes delirium and Levaquin causes prolonged QTs. MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Bactrim 800 mg/160 one tablet twice a day for one week skip one week and then Augmentin 500 mg three times a day. Potassium 40 milliequivalents twice a day. Protonix 40 mg once daily. Lasix 160 mg b.i.d., Uniphyl 200 mg q.d., Zestril 2.5 mg q.d., Serevent two puffs b.i.d., Flovent 110 micrograms four puffs twice a day. Combivent inhaler two puffs four times a day. Duo-neb solution four times a day as needed. Amiodarone 200 mg q.d., enteric coated aspirin 325 mg a day, Glyburide 5 mg once a day, Colace 100 mg twice a day, Senna prn, Coumadin 5 mg once a day except for 4 mg on Tuesday and Thursday, Neurontin 300 mg b.i.d., Oxycontin 20 mg t.i.d., Paxil 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 10 mg q.d., Ambien 15 mg q.h.s. and a regular insulin sliding scale. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient quit smoking in [**2175-5-28**] following a forty year history of smoking three to four packs a day. He consumed two to three drinks alcoholic drinks per day and was a construction worker. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient has a sister who died of cancer at the age of 39 and an older brother who had a coronary artery bypass graft. His father also had coronary artery disease and he had a sister with cardiac valvular disease. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This was a gentleman who was intubated, sedated and responsive only to noxious stimuli. Pupils were unremarkable. There were no bruits in the neck. Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, faint heart sounds overall. Occasional ectopic beats. Lungs were clear to auscultation on the left with transmitted breath sounds on the right. Abdomen was soft and mildly distended with decreased bowel sounds. Extremities showed no evidence of ulcers, trace edema in both lower extremities and no cyanosis or clubbing. Skin showed no evidence of rashes. LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Urinalysis was unremarkable. White blood cell count 23, hematocrit 42, platelets were 297. HOSPITAL COURSE: Upon admission to the hospital the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he was treated for presumed bronchitis versus tracheobronchitis versus atypical pneumonia. Blood sputum, urine and stool cultures were sent and Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin were started. 1. Infectious disease: The patient did not develop a focal infiltration throughout his hospitalization. His Ceftriaxone was stopped and he was continued on Azithromycin. He remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay and his white blood cell count decreased daily. On hospital day two he was stable for extubation and tolerated extubation very well. He was then transferred on hospital day number three out of the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor. He continued to improve clinically with a decrease in his fever curve and decrease in his oxygen requirements. He also subjectively improved and on his last hospital day he was comfortable and ambulating without oxygen. He stated that he had come back to his baseline. White blood cell count returned to [**Location 213**] range, and cultures were negative except for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge. 2. Pulmonary: This was treated as possible tracheobronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease versus atypical pneumonia. The patient was kept on his usual inhaler and nebulizing medications as well as Azithromycin and intravenous Solu-Medrol. After hospital day number two and the patient was extubated and improving the Solu-Medrol was switched to Prednisone and was rapidly tapered. The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was given regular respiratory treatment and chest physical therapy. By the end of the hospitalization the patient felt that he had returned to his baseline lung function, baseline pulmonary function and was coughing up less dark sputum. To manage his congestive heart failure Lasix was used judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily weights. The patient responded to this well and felt overall that his symptoms of volume overload had improved. 3. Cardiovascular: Based on his presentation, it was not clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent. Three sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of myocardial infarction. He had a number of electrocardiograms that were checked to ensure that he did not have a significantly prolonged QTC interval and that it was not worse. 4. Endocrine: The patient was followed with blood glucose measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor control with the Glyburide and the regular insulin sliding scale. As the regular insulin sliding scale was increased and the Prednisone was tapered these values returned closer to normal. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Improved. DISCHARGE STATUS: To home. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Humibid LA 600 mg b.i.d. 2. Lasix 160 mg b.i.d. 3. Potassium 40 milliequivalents po b.i.d. 4. Uniphyll 200 mg q.d. 5. Protonix 40 mg q.d. 6. Zestril 2.5 mg q.d. 7.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**], six hospitalizations since [**2176-5-27**], last discharged on [**2176-8-4**], with the diagnosis of tracheal bronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, versus atypical pneumonia, status post intubation in the MICU, chronic secretions/congestion-related problems, on alternating regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim since [**2175-9-28**] for multiple bronchitic-like infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, prior PEs, diabetes type 2, status post myocardial infarction, who presented with gradual shortness of breath beginning on the day of admission. The patient reported a [**1-29**] day history of general fatigue. On the day of admission, visiting nurse services reported a systolic blood pressure of 70. The wife drove the patient to the Emergency Room. The patient also complained of some dizziness, however denied other symptoms including fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms. He reported good p.o. intake and appetite. The patient reported that he has a chronic, slight cough, however, denied any sputum production. He took his oral temperature at home and denied any fever. At home, the patient is on oxygen of [**12-31**] L via nasal cannula. The patient recently finished a steroid taper on [**8-14**] which was two weeks in length. He reported a usual SBP of 80-110. The patient did note that since [**Month (only) 216**], a Scopolamine patch was added to his regimen and has increased his secretions significantly. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: Per Emergency Room, the patient appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2 of 48, and pO2 of 33. There was a question if this was a venous gas or not. Lasix 100 mg IV, Albuterol nebs, Solu-Medrol 600 mg IV, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV was given to the patient. When evaluated by the MICU shortly after arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down to baseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% via nasal cannula. The patient was breathing comfortably at 18-20 breaths/min. The patient no longer complained of shortness of breath but did state that he felt slightly tired. Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute PE. The patient reported that he was back to baseline in the Emergency Room. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Stage III squamous cell lung cancer diagnosis in [**2175-2-26**], status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**], with radiation, Carboplatin, and Taxol treatments. 2.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with wife and quit smoking in [**2175-5-28**]. He smoked 3-4 packs per day for 40 years. No alcohol abuse. He is a retired construction worker. FAMILY HISTORY: Sister died at age 39 of cancer. Brother is status post coronary artery bypass grafting. Father with history of coronary artery disease. Sister with heart valve disease. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature 98.5??????, heart rate 70, blood pressure 89-122/60-77, respirations 19-20, oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L nasal cannula. General: The patient was in no apparent respiratory distress. He was comfortable. He was alert and awake. HEENT: Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Normocephalic, atraumatic. Moist mucous membranes. Oropharynx clear. Cardiovascular: Regular, rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. Distant heart sounds. Without murmurs, rubs or gallops. Lungs: Loud rhonchi throughout the left lung field. No apparent wheezing or rubs. Transmitted sounds to right side. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. LABORATORY DATA: White count 10.4, hematocrit 30.0, which is baseline, platelet count 388; CHEM7 was unremarkable; PT 22.5, PTT 31.3, INR 3.5; B12 327, folate 12.7. Electrocardiogram unchanged from prior. Theophylline level 4.3. Chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no pneumothorax, no effusion. CT angiogram showed no acute PE, possible chronic PE in pulmonary artery segment in the left lower lobe that is not occlusive. HOSPITAL COURSE: This was a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of lung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 205**] for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim, recent hospitalization in MICU with intubation, chronic secretions, and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure, prior PEs, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with respiratory distress. 1. Respiratory distress: The patient was given Lasix, Albuterol nebs, and Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department and had rapid improvement of his symptoms. It was thought that the patient's acute respiratory distress was most likely secondary to mucous plugging. PE was ruled out by CTA. Chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure or pneumonia. The patient also recently completed a steroid taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this admission. He had no cough and no sputum production and no fevers. The patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids, as it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress and because it was unclear whether steroids was really benefitting this patient. He continued to have aggressive chest physical therapy for secretion management and was continued on his Scopolamine patch, Serevent, Combivent, Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, and inhalers. He was also continued on his alternating prophylactic antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim. He continued to do well and recorded oxygen saturations of greater than 92%. On the day of discharge, oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Of note, the patient was observed in the MICU overnight but was discharged to the floor quickly and had no other episodes of respiratory distress. 2. Hypotension: The visiting nurse noted a systolic blood pressure of 70; however, by the time the patient came to the Emergency Room, he had an SBP of 90. It was thought that the patient's slightly decreased SBP was secondary to hypovolemia. He was given gentle fluid hydration. He also had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been given to the patient. It was reportedly negative, but it was unclear as to how accurate this is in the setting of recent Solu-Medrol dosing. His Lasix was decreased from 160 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d., and his ACE inhibitor was discontinued. He continued to remain normovolemic during the rest of his hospitalization. 3. Cardiovascular: In terms of the patient's history of perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his Amiodarone and Lasix 80 mg b.i.d. He also continued Aspirin and Lipitor. His electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was thought that there was not any significant cardiac component to the patient's respiratory distress. 4. Endocrine: The patient was continued on his Glyburide and was covered with an Insulin sliding scale in the hospital. 5. History of pulmonary embolus: The patient was continued on his Coumadin while in-house. No further work-up was done. 6. CODE STATUS: THE PATIENT IS FULL CODE. DISPOSITION: He will be discharged to pulmonary rehabilitation to try to maximize his pulmonary status. He appears to be doing very well with physical therapy during this hospitalization and has slightly improved his exercise tolerance. He will also be started on a Morphine Elixir 5-10 mg sublingually p.r.n. q.6 hours for shortness of breath to relieve the patient's symptom of air hunger. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 2. Mucous plugging. 3. Congestive heart failure. 4. Hypotension. 5. Diabetes type 2. 6. History of pulmonary embolus on Coumadin therapy.

He presented to the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room on [**2177-11-25**]. At that time he denied diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, hematochezia and bright red blood per rectum. He had dark stools at baseline secondary to iron use. The stool was found to be guaiac positive in the Emergency Department. In the Emergency Department also his hematocrit value was 19, down from a baseline of 31 one month previously and he was coagulopathic with an INR of 9.8. Attempts to place a nasogastric tube in the Emergency Department were unsuccessful. While in the Emergency Department, he was transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg of subcutaneous Vitamin K. The patient was admitted to the Medicine Floor. Repeat hematocrit several hours later dropped to a value of 13. The nasogastric tube was placed on the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood. He was, at that point, transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7 cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately 25 cm. There was no evidence of stigmata of recent bleeding. He was stabilized with a total of seven units of packed red blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets. He also received intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline. Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed. Colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon. Internal hemorrhoids were noted but no stigmata of recent bleeding. The patient's coagulopathy was improving. His hematocrit was stable, and he was transferred to the General Medicine Floor on [**2177-11-28**]. Of note, prior to transfer he developed swelling of the right upper extremity and complained of pain of the right upper extremity. Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 2.

No rebound or guarding. Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Neurological examination: Nonfocal. LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data upon admission revealed complete blood count demonstrated a white blood cell count 19.2, hematocrit 19.0, platelets 381. Coagulation profile showed PT 38.5, PTT 38.0, INR 9.8. Serum chemistries showed sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 96, bicarbonate 30, BUN 52, creatinine 1.3, glucose 196. Liver function tests showed ALT 18, AST 26, amylase 23, lipase 24, albumin 3.4, alkaline phosphatase 100. Cardiac enzymes showed creatinine kinase 82, troponin I 0.04. Chest x-ray was negative for any acute pulmonary process. Abdominal x-ray demonstrated opacification of the right lung base. The left lung base was clear. There was no free air in the abdomen. There was a large amount of fecal material in the right colon. There was a normal bowel gas pattern. There was no evidence of obstruction. Later computerized tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no intra-abdominal abscess, bowel inflammation, evidence of perforated ulcer, appendicitis or diverticulitis. Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats/minute, normal axis, prolonged QT interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave inversions were noted in leads V1 and V2 which were new. No acute ST elevations or depressions noted. This was compared with the prior electrocardiogram from [**2177-10-9**]. HOSPITAL COURSE: In summary, this is a 63 year old male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-1-26**] complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and suctioning. He was in his usual state of health until [**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower abdominal pain, projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis. His hematocrit dropped from 31 to a nadir of 13. His gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. 1. Anemia secondary to acute blood loss - The patient's gastrointestinal workup included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one without source of frank bleed. However, in light of his initial complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, and guaiac positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected. Physically the small bowel could be the source. After stabilization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was transferred to the Medicine Floor after having stable hematocrit for greater than 24 hours. While on the floor, his hematocrit was checked initially every 12 hours. After demonstrating stability for a total of 72 hours it was spaced out to q. day hematocrit checks. All told the patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital stay. On [**2177-12-3**], the patient underwent repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study. At the time of this dictation results of those biopsies were pending. While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia. He had a normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19. Moreover, no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear. Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his hospital course and were consistent with changes status post large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing hemolysis. 2. Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - On [**2177-11-28**] the patient began to complain of right upper extremity pain and swelling. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated an axillary deep vein thrombosis. In light of his recent bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially. Although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the functionality of his one remaining lung. The computerized tomography scan was performed to better examine the right upper extremity soft tissues. In particular there was concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep vein thrombosis formation. Computerized tomographic venogram was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis, however. The patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses. Therefore, an inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**2177-12-2**]. The patient tolerated the procedure well. On [**2177-12-4**], the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling of the right lower extremity. Examination was consistent with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity. However, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging of the right lower extremity. In light of his probable hypercoagulability, decision was made to reinitiate anticoagulation with the Coumadin. His Coumadin level will be followed by his outpatient physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. His INR should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a goal INR of 2 to 3. 3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy - The patient was continued on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary toilet. He was continued on his outpatient medicines, Combivent, Salmeterol, and Theophylline. He was continued on antibiotic prophylaxis with Bactrim Double Strength in light of his history of bronchiectasis. He was monitored for acute decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. He continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint. He was diuresed gently after arriving to the Medicine Floor status post fluid resuscitation and blood product administration in the Medical Intensive Care Unit in the setting of his acute bleed. With the diuresis, pulmonary toilet and supportive care, his respiratory status improved somewhat. However, he is not back to his baseline of 2 liters of oxygen nasal cannula at home. At the time of discharge he was maintaining saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and shortness of breath, occasionally at rest. It was felt that a lot the patient's dyspnea was secondary to muscle deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital stay. Therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status. 4. Diabetes mellitus 2 - The patient was maintained on a diabetic diet, with q.i.d. fingersticks, fingerstick blood glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding scale. He was maintained on his outpatient dose of Neurontin for neuropathy. 5. Atrial fibrillation - He was continued on his outpatient dose of Amiodarone. Of note, he is currently in sinus rhythm. 6. Acute renal failure - The patient on admission had an elevated creatinine level above his baseline. This was likely secondary to prerenal causes, specifically hypovolemia and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his acute bleeding episode. His acute renal failure resolved after fluid hydration. 7. Vitamin B12 deficiency - The patient was continued on his outpatient regimen of supplementation with Vitamin B12, 1000 mcg p.o. b.i.d. 8. Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d. 9. Depression/anxiety - The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Paroxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d. 10. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was fed a diabetic heart-healthy diet. He received supplementation with multivitamins and Vitamin B12. Electrolytes were aggressively repleted. At the time of discharge he was tolerating regular diet without nausea, vomiting or other incident. DISPOSITION: With the patient's general deconditioning as well as his pulmonary status being slightly below his baseline I felt that he would benefit from an inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program. He will be discharged to such a program. DISCHARGE CONDITION: Hemodynamically stable. Afebrile. Oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula, ambulating independently, tolerating [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 243**] intake without nausea or vomiting.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION: Vitals: Temperature 98.4, pulse 94, blood pressure 100/65, respiratory rate 18, sat 96% on room air. In general, he is well developed, well nourished male; awake, alert, and oriented times three; in no acute distress. Appears dry. HEENT: Pupils are minimally reactive. Extraocular muscles are intact. Oropharynx is slightly dry; no lesions. Neck is supple; no lymphadenopathy; trach catheter in place; no jugular venous distention. Chest: With referred breath sounds on the right; left with firm rales, no wheezes. Heart is regular; normal S1, S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended; positive tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant severely and tender to palpation generalized throughout. Positive bowel sounds; no rebound or guarding; guaiac positive with red stool. Extremities: No edema; 5/5 strength in all extremities. LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION: White count of 13, hematocrit of 30, MCV of 90, platelets 272, sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, BUN 20, creatinine 1.0, glucose 149, CK 96, troponin 0.06. EKG with sinus rhythm at 94 with normal axis; poor baseline; no other ST-T wave changes. HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 63-year-old man with multiple medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on [**2178-1-15**] and represented with lower abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum and anemia. 1. Gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia: Most likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and polypectomy. Patient had a negative EGD and then had a colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of previous polypectomy. This was clipped with two clips with good control of the bleeding. Patient's hematocrit remained stable. He did receive a total of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission. After colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright red blood per rectum was noted. Patient's hematocrits were followed serially and remained in the 26, 27 range and eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to discharge, but his hematocrit remained 29 and 31 on day of discharge. Otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright red blood per rectum. Patient was initially started on Protonix 40 intravenously b.i.d. as his EGD was negative. Eventually was switched back to his 40 p.o. q. day regimen which he continued even as an outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease. Patient's blood pressure remained stable after transfused with blood. He also had a negative tagged red cell scan and negative EGD. Eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as in his previous admission. This was also negative. Patient could not have a Meckel scan during this stay because of barium and can have it at least one week after barium ingestion. Because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed, patient's Lovenox dose and Coumadin dose were continued to be held. Patient's anticoagulation, including aspirin, Coumadin, and Lovenox, were to be held for at least one week and can be restarted on [**2178-1-27**] per GI. 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Patient's respiratory status was stable and at baseline. Continued his home regimen of Advair, Combivent, and Theophylline and p.r.n. nebulizers as needed, although his pulmonary exam remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of 2 liters and will be discharged on the same regimen. 3. Status post lung cancer, status post pneumonectomy: Was stable with tracheostomy. Continued b.i.d. suctioning with good results. Continue the Scopolamine patch for antiemetics. 4. Prostate cancer: He does have recently rising PSA most recently 8.9 in 02/[**2177**]. Patient was eventually able to have a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony changes. Patient will be followed up with urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 261**], in terms of his prostate cancer follow up. 5. Troponin leak: This was attributed to demand ischemia. He had negative EKG changes, and he had a catheterization in [**1-/2175**] which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting disease. His enzymes remained stable through the course of his stay and was attributed to his anemia. Patient's aspirin was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted [**2178-1-27**]. Patient was continued on his statin. 6. Atrial fibrillation: Patient was in sinus rhythm throughout the course of his stay and was stable on Amiodarone. Again, his Coumadin was held for concerns with bleeding. 7. Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus: He has a history of [**Location (un) 260**] filter and right upper and right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. His hypercoagulable state is likely attributed to the prostate cancer, but otherwise his Coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons, and patient did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper and right lower extremity. Patient was taken off his Lasix dose through the course of the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability. Was given p.r.n. doses of Lasix throughout the stay and continued to elevate his extremities with good results of them. Patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis. The right lower extremity ultrasound was negative. The right upper extremity did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but no progression or change from previous studies, and this otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay. 8. Diabetes: He has fairly good control with hemoglobin A1C most recently at 6.0. He was continued on his home regimen of Glyburide once he was taking p.o. and covered with sliding scale as needed. For his neuropathy patient was continued on his Tylenol Number 3 and was discharged with a prescription for Morphine sulfate per his request, although he was not continued on this during the course of his stay. 9. Gout: This was stable throughout the course of his admission, but patient was continued on his home dose of Colchicine. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Lower gastrointestinal bleed. 2. Blood loss anemia. 3.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64 yo man s/p lung ca s/p pneumonectomy and severe COPD here after prolonged admission for respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy placement here with new left sided chest pain. . 1. Chest pain: Multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were cycled and CK/MB remained flat while troponin increased slightly and then remained stable at 0.12. Repeat EKGs showed no changes. Cardiology was consulted and agreed that there was no evidence of an acute ischemic event. Pt was continued on ASA. The pt's chest pain may be related to his chronic SVC syndrome. . 2. Respiratory Failure: Pt on a prolonged ventilator wean secondary to COPD, pneumonectomy, lung cancer and hx of recurrent pneumonias. Pt was continued on AC at night and pressure support during the day. He will continued to wean at rehab. . 3. Bilateral upper extremety swelling: This has been chronic since last admission w/o evidence of DVT. Pt had another CTA in the ER that showed no PE but did show a narrowing of the SVC. Interventional radiology placed a stent in the SVC and over the next several days, the pt's upper ext swelling improved. . 4. Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own. Pt was continued on his coumadin. . 5. Anxiety: Pt has a long history of anxiety controlled on fentanyl, morphine prn, haldol. AVOID benzos as pt has paradoxical response. * 6. Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease- baseline around 28. Iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal TIBC, ferritin. He was transfused once to [**Last Name (un) 291**] hct>30. . 7. DM type 2: Pt's glucose was controlled with glargine and an insulin sliding scale. . 8.

Also with a Urinary Tract Infection. Assessment/Plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p right pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Month/Day/Year 282**] [**Hospital **] rehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and UTI. . 1. Hypotension: [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to infection from UTI vs. symptomatic tachycardia. Responded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control. Remained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. Of note, his blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported that this is a [**Last Name 294**] problem for him. . 2. Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1 conduction. This initially responded to diltiazem. On hopital day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with Electrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem was stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 3.5 years in the past, and it had to be discontinued [**10-31**] due to bradycardia when lopressor was added). He remained in sinus rhythm for the remainder of the hospitalization. Plan is continue Amiodarone 400mg TID x 1 week then 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week then 200mg po QD thereafter. He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. 3. Respiratory Failure: His chest x-ray showed no evidence of Pneumonia. Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by respiraotory. An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to change the trach to a foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to ventilate. He was continued on PS as tolerated with periods of rest on Assist Control. . 4. Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: He was initally started on ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given history of heart block to levo, he was changed to Bactrim to complete a 7-day course for complicated UTI. The Urine Culture grew Klebsiella which is sensitive to Bactrim.His foley catheter was discontinued. . 5.Acute Blood Loss Anemia: His baseline hematocrit was 28-30. He was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3, his hematorcit dropped to 19. due to extensive bleeding from site of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an appropriate bump in his hematocrit. He was noted to have [**Known lastname **] guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive bleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his trach/mouth. His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient, and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for trace blood. . 6. Bleeding from Central Line site. He is maintained on coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic. After IJ placement, he had continued oozing from IJ site leading to anemia with hct 19. He was given FFP and vitamin K (0.5 mg iv) to reverse his coagultopathy. He should be restarted on coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab. . 5. Diabetes Mellitis: He was continued on glargine and regular insulin sliding scale. His sugars were in good control. . 6. Pain/anxiety/depression: He was continued on his outpatient doses of Fentanyl 75mcg/q72hours, Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. His pain is from his scaral decubitus ulcer. . 7. Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and continued on DSD for sacral wound. . 8. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: He had U/S which showed... . 9. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: He was given lasix prn to keep fluid even. . 10.Code: FULL . 11. Dispo: Discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab. . 12. Access: The Right Internal Jugular Vein triple lumen catheter was not discontinued per [**Hospital1 296**] request. This was placed on [**2179-3-21**]. ------ Outstanding issues on discharge: 1.The pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of discharge [**3-26**]. Please monitor his INR and adjust dose accordingly. 2.The pt has a swollen L arm and had U/S on day of discharge to r/o clot. No read has been given yet.

Patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from records. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-26**] after an admission at [**Hospital1 18**] for a Klebsiella UTI and hypotension. Since his admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to the commode with assistance. On [**4-11**], the pt became lethargic and then gradually unresponsive. On [**4-12**], his BP decreased to 60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. He received a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his BP to 90/40. He remained unresponsive during this time. ABG showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an FiO2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. Of note, pt's triple lumen was placed [**2179-3-21**]. . Wife later arrived at the hospital and was able to provide additional history. She reports that he had been doing very well until Friday. They were working on weaning him and he was able to be on the trach mask for 1-2 hours at a time. However, on Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report. He was maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend. Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked \"very scared\" and would often stare at the ceiling. He also had periods of his eyes \"rolling back in his head\". He was occasionally responsive to her. She reports that they had been checking ABGs over the last 24 hours and his CO2 had been elevated. When they changed the vent settings to decrease the CO2, she felt that he was slightly less confused. She also notes that he was very diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen. The pt's BP has always been very low in his left arm and she reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to a skin tear on the right. .

Nonspecific ST-T wave changes but no major changes since previous studies. . CXR- Stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. Right lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal contours toward the right consistent with previous pneumonectomy. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural effusion. Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left lung which appear stable. No new left pneumo or focal consolidation. . Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or evidence of hydrocephalus. No evidence of a major CVA. US upper extremity:IMPRESSION: 1) Nonocclusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein. 2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. The gallbladder is not distended. There is an 8-9 mm stone located at the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is thickened. There are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps located at the fundus of the gallbladder. No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The common duct is not dilated and measures 3 mm. Flow in the portal vein is anterograde. Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no focal abnormality. IMPRESSION: Thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder. In the proper clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with cholecystitis. They are not completely typical for acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening may also be produced by third spacing of fluids. If there is continued clinical concern for cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be performed for further evaluation. TECHNIQUE: CT images of the chest without the administration of IV contrast. COMPARISON: [**2176-9-11**] and [**2179-3-21**]. FINDINGS: Soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right. There is no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is a left pleural effusion. The patient is intubated with a tracheostomy tube. A stent is again identified within the right brachiocephalic vein. The heart demonstrates coronary calcifications, but is normal in size. The main pulmonary artery appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm. Lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the left lung. No specific areas of cavitation are identified within these nodules. Atelectasis is also seen at the left lung base. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. Septal thickening is seen throughout the left lung field. A small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities. However, on the study from [**2179-3-21**], this nodule was clearly seen and appears stable dating back to [**2176-9-11**]. The bronchi appear patent to the segmental level within the left lung. Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating to sludge. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen within the stomach. The remainder of the visualized portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable other than arterial calcifications. The soft tissues are unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: 1) Multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the entire left lung. These most likely represent aspiration pneumonia. Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the CT appearance. 2) Mild CHF. 3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of [**2179-3-21**] demonstrates stability dating back to [**2176-9-11**]. 4) Probable sludge within the gallbladder. 5) Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/o man with PMH significant for squamous cell lung CA, type 2 DM, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from [**Hospital1 **] with mental status change and hypotension. #ID/sepsis Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating blood pressure, lactate 1.3. His blood pressure in the ED was measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower). His blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors were off. Sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas), blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on discharge. His decubitus ulcer looks clean. His line was resited line to the right femoral. Chest CT was consistent with aspiration pneumonia. He will be continued on zosyn for 14 days. He remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the rest of his hospital stay. #Mental status changes: His mental status improved with decreasing CO2 and also with narcan. His CO2 remained well controlled in the hospital and was at baseline in 70s. CT head was negative. Narcotics was taken into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes. Patient's duragesic patch was removed in the ED. #anemia/coagulation Patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with IVC filter and SVC clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on coumadin. COumadin was taken off 3 days prior to hospital admission because he had blood oozing from his trach and foley. In hospital, central line was attempted intially on the right subclavian but the artery was puctured. His right femoral artery was also punctured and he did lose a signifcant amount of blood. The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no hematoma. He also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which revealed DVT in left arm for which he was started on heparin drip. He then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from arterial line site. Heparin drip was then stopped and he was given 2 unit of transfusion. His hematocrit had been stable since then. On discharge, coumadin was not restarted. It should be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable. . #transaminitis He presented intially with transaminitis likely from hypotension. LFTS trended down on discharge. RUQ ultrasound was done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension, thickened gallbladder. He remained afebrile and has no abdominal tenderness #respiratory: Patient has squamous cell lung CA post right pneumonectomy and post tracheostomy. During his past admission there was concern about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to prevent further tracheamalacia. Possible change the trach to a foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to ventilate. He remained on assist control ventilation. . # [**Name (NI) 300**] Pt with mildly elevated Na at 148. This is most likely due to water deficit as he can not drink to replace his needs. He recieved free water through G tube. . # Cardiac Patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such complain during this hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes were unremarkable. He was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia. . #Type 2 diabetes mellitus Patient was continued on standing 8U glargine and sliding scale while in hospital. #Anxiety/pain Patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at baseline. He was continues on his outpatient doses of Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. His pain is from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain. Anxiety has been severely worsened in the past with ativan. Would avoid further ativan. Fentanyl patch was discontinued since there was a concern regarding narcotic overdose. He was on prn morphine. THis should be adjusted in [**Hospital1 **]. # Sacral Decubitus: He had Kinair bed # FEN Tube feeds was continued with no residual #access He had picc line on discharge #code OK with pressor, do not resuscitate(confirmed again with family meeting) Medications on Admission: 1.
